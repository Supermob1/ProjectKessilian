# options for map_icon_category:
# For land units: infantry,armored,other
# For sea units: ship,transport,uboat

# MasterVeo1: I've decided to keep the original units incase we decide to do something with them for generic nations
# Every base unit will have 10,000 manpower and 1000 infantry equipment to avoid having too many units on the screen and causing lag
# The republic had upwards of up to 3 million manpower fielded during the clone wars.
# I've decided to use the naming convention "xxxx_basic" with there being different tiers.

# If you can please use the following categorization
# "xxxx_basic -> xxxx_standard -> xxxx_refined -> xxxx_advanced -> xxxx_elite -> xxxx_legendary"
# please ensure all naming is in lowercase form. Thank you.
# If you want to have higher level units please let us know by adding on to the key above for consistency
# use simple tech tab categorizations such as "tank_basic" or "artillery_elite" and avoid overcomplicated strings such as "tx130basicmodel_refined"
