 #REP TEST
 
 #Starting one
 REP_we_are_all_the_republic:0 "We Are All The Republic"
 REP_we_are_all_the_republic_desc:0 "The Galactic Republic is the cornerstone of modern galactic civilization. Even those systems that do not count themselves amongst its membership are impacted by the Republic and its decisions. It is made up of thousands of species, millions of planets, and trillions of citizens. For all its imperfections, the Republic was built by the People, for the People, of the People."
 REP_and_we_have_survived_millennia:0 "And We Have Survived Millennia"
 REP_and_we_have_survived_millennia_desc:0 "Democracy and inclusivity have reigned for millennia as the guiding principles and ideology of the Republic. For all the accusations of stagnation, it has survived numerous rivals, wars, and struggles. The Republic is old enough to be described as having no beginning, and most expect it shall have no end."
 REP_but_we_are_threatened_once_more:0 "But We Are Threatened Once More"
 REP_but_crisis_has_divided_us:0 "But Crisis Has Divided Us"
#Crisis
 REP_but_crisis_has_divided_us:0 "But Crisis Has Divided Us"
 REP_but_crisis_has_divided_us_desc:0 "The Republic's present crisis has not spawned from nothing. Corruption, discrimination, economic instability, and the decay of democratic values are all valid concerns. The Separatist Movement is radical and ultimately misguided, but we must recognize that their frustrations are not imagined. We must reach out to them, and work with the reformists to better the Republic for all of its citizens."
 REP_promise_a_future:0 "Promise a Future"
 REP_promise_a_future_desc:0 "Good governance begins with good goals. While they may just be pretty words at first, the Senate shall issue a statement of solidarity and unity, promising to investigate and redress the grievances of its citizens. This will not be done lightly. It shall be a promise to the Galaxy, a promise of a better future, that the Senate will be expected to make real." 
 REP_the_galactic_riots:0 "The Galactic Riots"
 REP_the_galactic_riots_desc:0 "Rioting has spread across the Republic. On any given day, on some planet somewhere there are mass demonstrations that devolve into violence. Most are either focused on the Separatist Movement, or on Humanocentric policies. Increasingly, these issues are linked. We must try to end the riots through negotiation with reformist leaders."
 REP_the_endless_marches_below:0 "The Endless Marches Below"
 REP_the_endless_marches_below_desc:0 "Even as we tackle the riots, our cooperation with some reformists has inspired many to take to the streets. Their methods remain non-violent and their demonstrations are peaceful, but they are endless, with thousands arriving in Core systems to make sure their issues are heard by those in power. While there is nothing wrong with protests, we must try to end them, for the sake of local economies and the sanity of those who live nearby. The only way forward is to try and demonstrate our commitment to reform."
 REP_statues_to_rim_worlds:0 "Statues to Rim Worlds"
 REP_statues_to_rim_worlds_desc:0 "In a gesture of unity, the Senate has authorized the creation of a number of statues on Coruscant. These statues will depict heroic figures from the Mid and Outer Rim, as well as historic moments in the histories of many major systems. In this way, the Rim worlds will be honored, and will hopefully help the government to regain some trust."
 REP_actions_speak_louder:0 "Actions Speak Louder"
 REP_actions_speak_louder_desc:0 "Declarations are nice. But if the Separatist Crisis is to be resolved and the Republic to endure in peace, words must be turned into action. The Senate will form a new committee dedicated to developing legislation aimed at genuinely resolving the issues the Separatists care about."
 REP_a_shot_at_the_monopolies:0 "A Shot at the Monopolies"
 REP_a_shot_at_the_monopolies_desc:0 "The root cause of the Separatist Crisis are the Megacorporations. Not only have they been a source of corruption , but they fund the Separatist Movement as a means of gaining even more autonomy. By drafting legislation meant to weaken them, but worded as focusing on ending corruption, we can both address both issues."
 REP_never_another_naboo:0 "Never another Naboo"
 REP_never_another_naboo_desc:0 "The debacle on Naboo should have been a wake up call. We must turn Naboo into a symbol of what corruption and miscommunication can cause. No sane sentient being can look at that situation and believe the invasion was moral! Of course, we shall admit that there were good people on both sides."
 REP_consult_the_peacekeepers:0 "Consult the Peacekeepers"
 REP_consult_the_peacekeepers_desc:0 "The Jedi Order has always stood for peace and cooperation. They are venerated, and even a Jedi's testimony stands as factual in a court of law. It is only logical that we bring on several Jedi Masters to advise on how to best resolve the Crisis."
 REP_promise_the_peace:0 "Promise the Peace"
 REP_promise_the_peace_desc:0 "More than just reform, the Republic will dedicate itself to ending the Separatist Crisis peacefully. Violence can never be the solution. Whether we completely answer their demands, or convince them to see our side of things, this will be a war won with words and wit, not blasters and barrages."
 REP_hear_out_the_separatists:0 "Hear out the Separatists"
 REP_hear_out_the_separatists_desc:0 "How can we hope to even begin solving the Separatist Crisis if we do not bring those Separatists to the table? A natural step in the path to peace is to invite Separatist leaders to speak with Republic envoys, so that a dialogue can begin to resolve the issue."
 REP_the_long_corporate_shadow:0 "The Long Corporate Shadow"
 REP_the_long_corporate_shadow_desc:0 "Corporations have long played a part in the growth and prosperity of the Republic, from the tax-free economic zones to the authorization of privately-owned planets. Trying to reverse generations of entrenchment triggered this crisis. But we have to try, slowly and steadily, to reverse the trend of corporate control in the Republic."
 REP_the_first_and_last_domino:0 "The First and Last domino"
 REP_the_first_and_last_domino_desc:0 "Naboo was where this all started, even if it took nearly a decade to truly take shape. It has to stop there. Patriotic planetary militias are mobilizing, and we shall give this our tacit approval, in the hopes that making war vastly more costly and dangerous will pressue the Separatist Movement to negotiate."
 REP_hear_out_our_own:0 "Hear out our Own"
 REP_hear_out_our_own_desc:0 "The Separatists may have the spotlight, but there are millions, if not billions of Republic citizens struggling with inequality, oppression, and discrimination. By reaching out to community leaders and giving the floor to testimonials, we can start to convince the general public that the path of peaceful reform is not just righteous, but necessary."
 REP_the_long_road_to_equality:0 "The Long Road to Equality"
 REP_the_long_road_to_equality_desc:0 "There is an uncomfortable truth few wish to admit. While the Republic is proudly a democracy, many of its member worlds are monarchies, theocracies, and even dictatorships. We have believed in the right of systems to choose their own government, but this is what divided us, as some live free, and others can only grow bitter at our hipocrisy. Autonomy will be sacrificed, but efforts to create true equality for all will weaken the Separatists."
 REP_recognition_of_non_humans:0 "The Recognition of Non-Humans"
 REP_recognition_of_non_humans_desc:0 "Non-Humans have been fundamental to the growth of the Republic, with the Duros as a founding species. And yet Humans and Near-Humans have always dominated, politically and economically. Greater diversity in government and law enforcement, as well as showcasing Non-Human achievements is a way to start reversing this trend."
 REP_beyond_the_core:0 "Beyond the Core"
 REP_beyond_the_core_desc:0 "Thus far, our new policies have only seen widespread application in the Core regions. This is logical, as they are both the most stable and least dispersed. But now we must roll out our first wave of reforms in force to the Inner Rim, Mid Rim, and Expansion Regions."
 REP_an_invitation_to_raxus:0 "An Invitation to Raxus"
 REP_an_invitation_to_raxus_desc:0 "In a momentous gesture of reconciliation, Count Dooku and other Separatist leaders have invited a delagation of Republic Senators to meet on Raxus Secundus, the unofficial capital of the Separatist Movement. Talks are planned to be extensive, covering a wide range of issues at the heart of the Crisis. We must capitalize on this offer. Preparations are underway to try and utilize this opportunity. This could very well be our chance to finally end the Crisis, and from there we can beging to truly reform the Republic!"
#Threat
 REP_but_we_are_threatened_once_more:0 "But we are threatened once more"
 REP_but_we_are_threatened_once_more_desc:0 "The peaceful aims of reformists are born from noble intentions, but they are ultimately misguided. If these “Separatists” truly intended to negotiate in good faith, they would not be trying to damage the unity of the Republic in pursuit of petty political goals. Such radicalism must be dealt with firmly and uncompromisingly, not coddled as the parties of peace intend."
 REP_and_we_shall_not_stand_idle:0 "And we shall not stand idle"
 REP_and_we_shall_not_stand_idle_desc:0 "Our allies in the Senate are preparing a battery of new proposals to prepare our economy, law enforcement, and even public discourse for the coming crisis. While these measures may seem disruptive at first glance, they are simply a recognition of a principle that has held firm for a millennium: Every citizen must rally to defend our great Republic in her time of need."
 REP_the_weakness_of_ruusan:0 "The Weakness of Ruusan"
 REP_the_weakness_of_ruusan_desc:0 "For a thousand years has the Ruusan Reformation stood largely unchallenged, and truth be told it has served its purpose well. Yet while the Republic has grown with no enemy to fight, it was a mishandled process. We traded prosperity for utter hopelessness - one that we carefully hid, thinking the monsters of the past would not resurface once more.\n\nThe Ruusan Constitution grows old... We will tear it apart piece by piece if need be, for patriots cannot hope to defend the Republic if picking up a blaster in its name is illegal."
 REP_encourage_local_militarisation:0 "Encourage Local Militarization"
 REP_encourage_local_militarisation_desc:0 "Proving the falsehood of their claims to be a peaceful political movement, the Separatists have begun to arm themselves. Despite the lamentable state of our armed forces, we must mount a strong response to these brazen threats to our society. Empowering sector and system governments to militarize will enable them to counter the Confederate threat."
 REP_the_war_on_pacifism:0 "The War on Pacifism"
 REP_the_war_on_pacifism_desc:0 "It has become obvious to all that the divides in our Republic are deepening, and refusing to pick a side only fractures its foundations further. Though we were once willing to tolerate the pacifists’ reservations, their continued intransigence demonstrates a lack of loyalty to our founding ideals. Such unpatriotic—perhaps even treasonous—behavior can no longer be tolerated."
 REP_anti_separatist_propaganda:0 "Anti-Separatist Propaganda"
 REP_anti_separatist_propaganda_desc:0 "The battle for the soul of the Republic is as much a conflict of hearts and minds as of politics and law. A mass propaganda campaign will ensure that the galactic masses see the virtues of the Republic—as well as the moral bankruptcy at the heart of the Separatist movement."           
 REP_fight_confederate_terrorism:0 "Fight Confederate Terrorism"
 REP_fight_confederate_terrorism_desc:0 "Count Dooku and his supporters are dangerous demagogues whose inflammatory rhetoric incites violence and terrorism against the legitimate galactic government. With this in mind, the Judicial Forces will compile a list of Dooku’s most ardent advocates and monitor their actions carefully. With the help of this task force, we will be forewarned and forearmed when Dooku calls for the conflict to escalate."
 REP_embargoes_in_all_but_name:0 "Embargoes in all but Name"
 REP_embargoes_in_all_but_name_desc:0 "It is utter folly to waste the productive capacities of the Republic on those who would spit on its generosity. Worse still, trading with the Confederacy helps it build up the industrial and military capacity to attack us. We must cut them off from our trade networks before they weaken us any further."
 REP_mobilise_the_jedi:0 "Mobilize the Jedi"
 REP_mobilise_the_jedi_desc:0 "The Jedi Order has repeatedly professed its loyalty to the Republic—and now is the time to put those oaths to the test. Their religious convictions must not stand in the way of their duties to our nation; they may be called upon to investigate its enemies, protect its interests, and perhaps even wage war in its defense."
 REP_and_we_shall_give_up_no_ground:0 "And we shall give no ground"
 REP_and_we_shall_give_up_no_ground_desc:0 "The more sectors join the Separatists and the more their ideology spreads, the more difficult it will become to prevent this situation from spiraling out of control. We will launch a political campaign to proactively ensure the loyalties of our citizenry, creating Republican strongholds where there now exists internecine conflict."
 REP_in_the_wider_galaxy:0 "In the Wider Galaxy"
 REP_in_the_wider_galaxy_desc:0 "The Republic consists of 1,024 sectors, encompassing a vast number of systems, planets, and local governments. Aligning them all is nigh-impossible, so we will focus on the bigger picture: preventing the defection of strategic sectors, containing those that have already declared their allegiance to the Confederacy, and limiting the “domino effect” of defecting regions influencing their neighbors towards Separatism."
 REP_the_loyal_of_the_rim:0 "The Loyal of the Rim"
 REP_the_loyal_of_the_rim_desc:0 "Though the Mid and Outer Rim are hotbeds of Separatist sentiment, there are still some there who have not forgotten their responsibilities to the Republic. Fostering loyalist sentiment in the outlying regions will be of great help in our struggle, for each world we bring on board brings us one step closer to strangling the Confederacy in its cradle."
 REP_the_shield_against_corporations:0 "The Shield against Corporations"
 REP_the_shield_against_corporations_desc:0 "The Shield Against Corporations: The Naboo Crisis paints a clear picture of the danger of megacorporate influence. The values of the banks and merchant guilds are alien to those of our virtuous Republic, and they wield private droid armies with which to enforce them on upstanding citizens. No more will their power go unchecked: they will be brought in line or else exposed for the traitors they are."
 REP_or_at_home:0 "Or at Home"
 REP_or_at_home_desc:0 "The growth of the Separatist movement has unfortunately sparked riots even on key Republic worlds such as Corellia, Alderaan, and Coruscant. Quelling this unrest and restoring law and order is crucial to presenting a united front against Count Dooku."
 REP_never_another_naboo:0 "Never another Naboo" 
 REP_the_loyal_of_the_core:0 "The Loyal of the Core"
 REP_the_loyal_of_the_core_desc:0 "The Core Worlds have been the Republic’s staunchest supporters since time immemorial. With the riots dying down, there has never been a better time to shore up that support. With the Core standing together as one, we will have a strong and stable base from which to fight back against the insidious influence of Separatism."
 REP_the_brewing_race_war:0 "The Brewing Race War"
 REP_the_brewing_race_war_desc:0 " Across hundreds of planets, the Human and Alien clashes. Cities burn, alien planets secede and the Republic shrinks - but in our apparent loss we see victory - we needn't say anything for people to take up arms over nation or ideology anymore.\n\nThe bullseye is painted - our greatest victory begins with a great loss."
 REP_the_blue_scare:0 "The Blue Scare"
 REP_the_blue_scare_desc:0 "Open your eyes, people of the Republic, our enemies are in our midst!\n\nThe Republic is threatened and it shall no longer take high treason without punishment. Look around yourselves and see how rotten our civilisation is - actively torn apart from the inside, from the Galactic Senate to individual housing units. Apprehend these vile terrorists, take a stand against them for yourself and for your family! For your neighbours and your nation! For if you do not, tomorrow it could all be washed away by the Blue Wave."
 REP_and_we_shall_last_another_thousand:0 "And we shall last another Thousand"
 REP_and_we_shall_last_another_thousand_desc:0 "The Galactic Republic has lasted for twenty five thousand years. It has gone through hard times, horrible times. Not three thousand years back the people that sat in our seats asked this same question and thought of the future; I offer you a future!\n\nThe likes of Sith and Eternal Empires will humble our Republic no more! For hundreds of years we have fought bloody conflicts because we refused to strike first, or because we were too blind to see them coming. Our fleets stand ready outside occupied territory - Today, the Republic will make the first move, and it will be one that exposes the Separatists for what monstrous radicals they truly are.\n\nWe will prove to the Galaxy that our flag will always fly! May it ever stand for safety, security, justice, and peace!"
 #MCA
 REP_the_military_creation_act:0 "The Military Creation Act"
 REP_the_military_creation_act_desc:0 "The Military Creation Act, as Palpatine has labeled his newest possible proposal to his cabinet, is not a new idea. The creation of a central armed forces for the Republic has been a hotly debated topic ever since the Ruusan Reformation.\n\nIn the past, various iterations of such a bill have been soundly defeated in the Senate. But with the Separatist Crisis building, it is time to revist the subject. At the least, the debate could startle the Separatists into calming down..."
 REP_rework_the_bill:0 "Rework the Draft"
 REP_rework_the_bill_desc:0 "The rough draft of the MCA has been completed, but it is largely based on bills rejected by the Senate. It must be revised if it stands a chance of passing, and it would be foolhardy to not update its language to reflect the state of the evolving crises it is being aimed to solve. This will take time, but Vice Chancellor Amedda has dutifully offered his services."
 REP_oppose_the_mca:0 "Oppose the Act"
 REP_oppose_the_mca_desc:0 "Senators Bel Iblis and Mothma are right! The Military Creation Act is more than an affront to the Ruusan Constitution, it is an affront to the principles of the Republic! A central military represents greater central power, and will likely only incense the autonomy-minded base of the Separatist Movement. In the name of sanity and self-determination, the MCA must be opposed."
 REP_age_old_alliance:0 "Age Old Alliance"
 REP_age_old_alliance_desc:0 "The informal, Mid-Rim dominated "Inclusivist" faction of the Senate has long had an alliance with the more aristocratically-minded Core Senators, stretching back centuries. Despite their top-down view of social reform, many of these Corists are proudly progressive and opposed to authoritarian centralization. \n\nIn building a united Opposition to the MCA, the Inclusivists reach out to these likeminded Corists to whip their allies into a stronger voting block. "
 REP_reach_across_the_aisle:0 "Reach across the Aisle"
 REP_reach_across_the_aisle_desc:0 "Traditionally, those who champion the Ruusan Reformation as the pinnacle of good governance do not align with the Inclusivist faction. Often they are at odds with Inclusivist proposals for social programs and economic interventionism.\n\nBut the MCA is something both sides can agree is an atrocity. Against Ruusanist values and against Inclusivist ideals. A meeting should be held between faction leaders to form a united front."
 REP_the_counter_proposal:0 "The REPUBLIC Act"
 REP_the_counter_proposal_desc:0 "The new Opposition coalition cannot just shut down the MCA without offering some alternatives. A crisis is approaching, and proponents will villify us if we do not have a counter-proposal.\n\nTogether, we shall draft an omnibus bill known as the Regional Empowerment for the Protection of Unity, Belligerency Limitation, and Local Intelligence Cooperation Act, or simply the REPUBLIC Act."
 REP_support_the_mca:0 "Support the Act"
 REP_support_the_mca_desc:0 "Chancellor Palpatine is right! The Military Creation Act is a necessary reform in order to safeguard our founding principles and liberties from its enemies, and will help to keep the Separatist Movement in check. In the name of safety and stability, the MCA must be supported."
 REP_rally_the_idealogues:0 "Rally the Radicals"
 REP_rally_the_idealogues_desc:0 "Amongst the so-called "Inclusivist" faction of the Senate are radical progressives and anticorporate reformists. While their faction is generally opposed to Unitist ideals of centralization and patriotic utilitarianism, many of them are terrified and disgusted by the corporate and xenonationalist elements within the Separatist Movement.\n\nBy reminding them as well of the Naboo Crisis, and how a Republic military would mean greater ease of ensuring compliance to reforms, we can sway these radicals to supporting the MCA."
 REP_necessary_concessions:0 "Corist Concessions"
 REP_necessary_concessions_desc:0 "Many of the aristocratic Core Senators have sympathy for a central military. We can play into their fear of Outer-Rim rable, and remind them of the recent instability of the Mid-Rim to garner more support from their centralist members.\n\nHowever, we will need to offer concessions to bring their faction fully on-board. Perhaps a guarantee of Core-world leadership in military command as the heart of the Republic..."
 REP_alter_the_terms:0 "Alter the Terms"
 REP_alter_the_terms_desc:0 "We have managed to create a sizable coalition of proponents for the MCA. However, it may not be enough. Certainly, many of our allies may turncoat at the last minute, and several of their faction members are already in league with the Opposition. A committee must be formed to amend the MCA to better appeal to the coalition as whole.\n\nYes, this may water down and weaken the MCA, but better something than nothing."
 REP_the_vote:0 "The Vote"
 REP_the_vote_desc:0 "It's time. We've built our coalition. We've spent weeks in board rooms writing and revising legislation. Now the final debates must begin.\n\nThis will be a lengthy process. The whole of the Senate must gather, which will take time, and the debates will surely be riddled with filibustering, last minute objections, political extortion, and other forms of unsavory politicking. But eventually fate of the MCA will be decided one way or another."
 REP_killed_in_the_cradle:0 "Killed in the Cradle"
 REP_killed_in_the_cradle_desc:0 "It's done. The Military Creation Act has failed. This is not the first time the concept of a unified military for the Republic has died in the Senate. But this time, at such a crucial juncture, the gesture signifies a loud message of pacifism, autonomism, and Constitutional textualism in the Republic. Any legislation offered in counter will need months to be ready for debate, but already the process has begun in the background."
 REP_one_army_one_republic:0 "Birth of A National Army"
 REP_one_army_one_republic_desc:0 "It's done. The Military Creation Act has succeeded. This is the first time that the concept of a unified military for the Republic has not died in the Senate. In doing so, at such a crucial juncture, the gesture signifies a loud message of jingoism, centralism, and Constitutional pragmatism in the Republic. Now shall begin the grueling process of organzing the military, planning its exact structure, fielding officer candidates, and allocating funding. It may take months, but entire committees are dedicating their full attention to get started."

 CIS_the_future_of_the_dark_side:0 "The Future of the Dark Side"
 CIS_the_future_of_the_dark_side_desc:0 "The first, and most important, decision that Tyranus must make is simple to state but very difficult to answer: what is to be done with the Rule of Two? Will he abide by the iron law of Bane or remake the Sith in his own image?"
 CIS_always_two:0 "Always Two, There Are"
 CIS_always_two_desc:0 "The Sith Empires of the past collapsed into infighting because the power of the Dark Side was spread too thin, placed in too many hands. The Rule of Two must be maintained so that the will of the Sith remains uncontested."
 CIS_betrayal_is_the_sith_way:0 "Betrayal is the Sith Way"
 CIS_betrayal_is_the_sith_way_desc:0 "Darth Sidious is furious at the creation of the new Sith Empire, but his rage means nothing. If he is incapable of dealing with treachery, he is unworthy of the mantle of Dark Lord. It is time to make the final break from his control: Tyranus must take an apprentice of his own."
 CIS_his_loyal_right_hand:0 "His 'Loyal' Right Hand"
 CIS_his_loyal_right_hand_desc:0 "Asajj Ventress has already been training in the ways of the Sith for years. With Sidious no longer in command, there is no need for any further subterfuge about Tyranus's intentions for her. It is time to make her a Sith Lord in name as well as in fact."
 CIS_the_prodigal_daughter:0 "The Prodigal Daughter"
 CIS_the_prodigal_daughter_desc:0 "Ventress has fled, swearing vengeance on Tyranus and anyone who aids him. But there is no sense in dwelling now on the training that went to waste, or scenarios that might have been--it is time to consider alternative options."
 CIS_continue_her_training:0 "Continue Her Training"
 CIS_continue_her_training_desc:0 "Ventress has been trained well: besides Tyranus himself, only the greatest of Jedi can surpass her skill with lightsabers or the Force. Now that she can train openly, it is time to intensify her trials to prepare her for the role of a Sith apprentice."
 CIS_confirm_her_allegiance:0 "Confirm Her Allegiance"
 CIS_confirm_her_allegiance_desc:0 "Despite the promise she shows, Ventress has displayed signs of disloyalty in the past--not just to Dooku, but to the Dark Side itself. Obviously, this is unacceptable; she must be brought in line before her apprenticeship can go forward."
 CIS_demand_her_obedience:0 "Demand Her Obedience"
 CIS_demand_her_obedience_desc:0 "A commitment to the Dark Side may be necessary for Ventress to achieve her destiny, but it is not sufficient. She must obey Tyranus in all things...at least, until the time is ripe for her to overthrow him."
 CIS_seek_a_new_apprentice:0 "Seek a New Apprentice"
 CIS_seek_a_new_apprentice_desc:0 "Fortunately, Ventress is not the only person in the galaxy who is strong in the Dark Side. Several other plausible candidates for a new apprentice have presented themselves--but only one will rise to the vaunted title of "Darth"."
 CIS_the_renegade:0 "The Renegade"
 CIS_the_renegade_desc:0 "Quinlan Vos abandoned the weakness of the Jedi during an attempt to assassinate Tyranus. His hatred for his master will fuel his dark powers, always a desirable quality in a Sith apprentice."
 CIS_the_butcher:0 "The Butcher"
 CIS_the_butcher_desc:0 "Pong Krell proved his worth with a brutal massacre of clones on Umbara. His contempt for the weakness of his inferiors could become the core principle of a new Sith Lord under Tyranus's tutelage."
 CIS_the_ideologue:0 "The Ideologue"
 CIS_the_ideologue_desc:0 "Barriss Offee turned against the Jedi Order late in the war, committing multiple terrorist attacks and framing her former friend Ahsoka Tano for her actions. With the proper training, she could be reforged into an exemplary Sith."
 CIS_the_outsider:0 "The Outsider"
 CIS_the_outsider_desc:0 "Savage Oppress was once Ventress's ally in her vendetta against Tyranus, but he can serve the dark side better as a new Sith apprentice. Forcing him to submit to Tyranus's will is bound to be no easy task, but it will be worthwhile nonetheless."
 CIS_break_him_down: "Break Him Down"
 CIS_break_him_down_desc:0 "To ensure that there is no chance of the light reasserting itself in Vos, all vestiges of his former identity must be destroyed by any means necessary. It will be a painful process, to say the least--but his suffering will only make him stronger."
 CIS_encourage_his_bloodlust:0 "Encourage His Bloodlust"
 CIS_encourage_his_bloodlust_desc:0 "Krell is a being who takes joy in slaughter, for whom the suffering and death of his foes is its own reward. Bringing this quality to the forefront of his psyche will strengthen his connection to the Dark Side."
 CIS_twist_her_morals:0 "Twist Her Morals"
 CIS_twist_her_morals_desc:0 "Unlike the other potential apprentices, Offee still clings to a misguided sense of "morality". But, while unfortunate, this weakness is not insurmountable. She must simply be...convinced...that the only way to accomplish her goals is to set those fetters aside."
 CIS_alter_his_body:0 "Alter His Body"
 CIS_alter_his_body_desc:0 "Oppress is a titanic being with immense strength and durability, but it is not in the nature of the Sith to be satisfied with any amount of power, no matter how great. With sorcery and cybernetics Oppress's form can be enhanced even further...while making him dependent on his Master."
 CIS_build_him_anew:0 "Build Him Anew"
 CIS_build_him_anew_desc:0 "Once his Jedi origins have been consigned to oblivion, Vos must be reeducated and indoctrinated into Sith philosophy. His fragile mind can be molded by the superior power of Tyranus, making him an utterly fanatical devotee of the Dark Side."
 CIS_rise_darth_enigma:0 "Rise, Darth Enigma"
 CIS_rise_darth_enigma_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Quinlan Vos is no more. In his place rises Darth Enigma, a being of pure hatred. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall annihilate their foes."
 CIS_feed_his_malice:0 "Feed His Malice"
 CIS_feed_his_malice_desc:0 "The unique combination of cunning, brute force, and utter lack of compassion or empathy that enabled Krell to trick the 501st and 212th into murdering many of their own men is impressive for one so new to the Dark Side. He must be taught to develop and rely on those skills."
 CIS_rise_darth_lanius:0 "Rise, Darth Lanius"
 CIS_rise_darth_lanius_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Pong Krell is no more. In his place rises Darth Lanius, a remorseless slayer of the weak. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall make the galaxy bleed."
 CIS_nurture_her_rage:0 "Nurture Her Rage"
 CIS_nurture_her_rage_desc:0 "Offee carries a deep, vicious fury at the Jedi and their allies, and desires revenge on them at any cost. These emotions should be encouraged and strengthened in order to push her further down the path of the Sith."
 CIS_rise_darth_abyssal:0 "Rise, Darth Abyssal"
 CIS_rise_darth_abyssal_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Barriss Offee is no more. In her place rises Darth Abyssal, determined to reshape the galaxy in her image. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall reign supreme."
 CIS_corrupt_his_mind:0 "Corrupt His Mind"
 CIS_corrupt_his_mind_desc:0 "Oppress's attachments to his ally Ventress and his brother Maul are a weakness--and worse still, a weakness that can be used against not just him, but Tyranus as well. If he is to be an effective apprentice, he must come to despise all those he once fought alongside."
 CIS_rise_darth_irae:0 "Rise, Darth Irae"
 CIS_rise_darth_irae_desc:0 "Savage Oppress is no more. In his place rises Darth Irae, a wrathful force of destruction. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall crush all opposition."
 CIS_rise_darth_umbral:0 "Rise, Darth Umbral"
 CIS_rise_darth_umbral_desc:0 "Asajj Ventress is no more. In her place rises Darth Umbral, the first acolyte of darkness. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall rise again, stronger than ever before."

 #OUTER RIM COMMONWEALTH#
 ORC_the_congress_of_mos_espa:0 "The Congress Of Mos Espa"
 ORC_the_congress_of_mos_espa_desc:0 "The Outer Rim's war of independence has been won, but our struggle must go on. To that end, it is time to replace the Provisional Government. Democratically-elected delegates from all over our territory are coming together in Mos Espa to determine the future of the Outer Rim."
 ORC_the_communal_federation_of_outer_rim:0 "The Communal Federation Of The Outer Rim" 
 ORC_the_communal_federation_of_outer_rim_desc:0 "The Federationists have emerged victorious in the Mos Espa Congress. In accordance with their vision, the new government of the Outer Rim will be highly decentralized, run by workers' councils and local communes."
 ORC_the_conquest_of_portions:0 "The Conquest Of Portions"
 ORC_the_conquest_of_portions_desc:0 "The seeds of a free and equal society are already present in the decentralized revolutionary organizations that formed in the years preceding the rebellion, such as the Sullustan unions or the Tatooine freedom trails. Instead of dissolving these groups, we should formalize them as the nucleus of a new government."
 ORC_mutual_aid:0 "Mutual Aid"
 ORC_mutual_aid_desc:0 "Every good Distributionist knows that we are at our strongest when we stand in solidarity with our fellow sentients. By sending representatives to talk to local leaders across the Rim, we can make sure that our comrades don't suffer for lack of resources or personnel."
 ORC_community_self-defense:0 "Community Self-Defense"
 ORC_community_self-defense_desc:0 "Lacking a strong central government doesn't have to mean that we can't protect ourselves and defend the revolution. By retaining the local militias that were raised during the rebellion, we can set up a first line of defense against invasion."
 ORC_social_liberation:0 "Social Liberation"
 ORC_social_liberation_desc:0 "True equality cannot be achieved while even the smallest remnant persists of the oppressive and hierarchical power structures that once held us down. We will therefore campaign across the Outer Rim against all types of bigotry and prejudice, so that all of our citizens can have an equal share in the new revolutionary order."
 ORC_wretched_hives_no_more:0 ""Wretched Hives" No More"
 ORC_wretched_hives_no_more_desc:0 "For centuries, the Outer Rim has been host to all manner of criminal activity. Spice addiction, human trafficking, and extortion run rampant even now. Without a powerful state to combat such problems, it is imperative that the communes work together to clean up the frontier."
 ORC_we_love_direct_democracy:0 "We Love (Direct) Democracy"
 ORC_we_love_direct_democracy_desc:0 "Democratic governance is crucial to a free society. But unlike the "democracy" of the Republic or Separatist Senate, we understand the importance of putting the people first. We must promote direct democracy so that citizens will have a voice in the issues most important to their lives."
 ORC_municipal_development:0 "Municipal Development"
 ORC_municipal_development_desc:0 "Despite the rapid industrialization that took place during the war, large swathes of the Outer Rim are still undeveloped and poor. A wave of new local infrastructure and development projects will make the communes more self-sufficient and prosperous."
 ORC_rebellions_are_built_on_hope:0 "Rebellions Are Built On Hope"
 ORC_rebellions_are_built_on_hope_desc:0 "We still have a long way to go, but we have proven that our objective is more than a pipe dream. The results we've produced in just a few short months will rally more people to our cause and raise the morale of our own loyal supporters."
 ORC_the_galactic_frontier_state:0 "The Galactic Frontier State"
 ORC_the_galactic_frontier_state_desc:0 "The Centralists have carried the day in Mos Espa. Their program calls for a mass mobilization of the people of the Outer Rim for a continuing struggle against imperialism and reactionary ideology."
 ORC_political_power_flows_from_the_barrel_of_a_blaster:0 "Political Power Flows From The Barrel Of A Blaster"
 ORC_political_power_flows_from_the_barrel_of_a_blaster_desc:0 "The recent victory of the Distributionist forces marks only the first stage of the revolutionary struggle. We shall continue it into the future by inducting the leaders of the mass popular uprisings into our party. Their connections to the masses will allow us to remain in tune with the needs of our power base."
 ORC_the_cultural_revolution:0 "The Cultural Revolution"
 ORC_the_cultural_revolution_desc:0 "It is the responsibility of a Distributionist state to continue the class struggle at any cost. Every available resource must be committed to stomping out reactionaryism, landlordism, and imperialist ideology."
 ORC_green_guards:0 "Green Guards"
 ORC_green_guards_desc:0 "The most devoted Distributionists among our people are forming "Green Guard" cells to show their commitment to our ideals. We should encourage this in order to create a loyal and ideologically correct source of support amongst the wider population."
 ORC_continue_the_drive_to_industrialise:0 "Continue The Drive To Industralise"
 ORC_continue_the_drive_to_industrialise_desc:0 "We have made sweeping progress over the course of the war in transforming the Outer Rim from an exploited frontier region to an advanced modern state. But our work is not yet done. Maintaining the rapid growth of our heavy industry is necessary for our long-term goals."
 ORC_resistance_is_not_terrorism:0 "Resistance Is Not Terrorism"
 ORC_resistance_is_not_terrorism_desc:0 "While they may have been necessary to liberate us from the imperialists, the ruthless tactics of our faction have alienated many of the Federationists and moderates. We should try to rally them back to our side with a propaganda campaign."
 ORC_distributionist_internationalism:0 "Distributionist Internationalism"
 ORC_distributionist_internationalism_desc:0 "Our commitment to Distributionism must reach beyond our borders. Workers suffer under corporate exploitation not just in the Outer Rim, but all across the galaxy. We should reach out to other Distributionist parties to begin setting up a truly galactic movement."
 ORC_expand_the_party:0 "Expand The Party"
 ORC_expand_the_party_desc:0 "With a vast territory to govern and only a small cadre of committed Centralists with which to do it, it is clear that it has become necessary to fill out the lower ranks of our party and bring fresh faces into the fold. In short, we need to launch an Outer-Rim-wide recruitment campaign."
 ORC_we_are_the_spark:0 "We Are The Spark"
 ORC_we_are_the_spark_desc:0 "As the first true Distributionist state in the galaxy, it is our task to lead the revolution by example. Our success will inspire workers across the galaxy to rise up and throw off their shackles, for where there is oppression, there is revolt."
 ORC_the_united_systems_of_the_outer_rim:0 "The United System Of The Outer Rim"
 ORC_the_united_systems_of_the_outer_rim_desc:0 "With no consensus being reached at the Congress of Mos Espa, a Popular Front has been formed to ensure stability. However, the fragmentation of the main factions has enabled the Inclusivists to demand concessions."
 ORC_our_property_our_honour_our_lives:0 "Our Property, Our Honour, Our Lives"
 ORC_our_property_our_honour_our_lives_desc:0 "The Popular Front is shaky at best, but we can shore it up by bringing the Inclusivists on board. This will limit our ability to pursue radical goals, but it may win us some support from more moderate groups among our population, especially in developed ex-Republic worlds like Rodia and Christophsis."
 ORC_state-owned_enterprise:0 "State-Owned Enterprise"
 ORC_state-owned_enterprise_desc:0 "The Distributionist idea of seizing the means of production can be accomplished by putting crucial industries and economic sectors under the control of a democratically-elected government. We will nationalize industry to remove the profit motive from the equation."
 ORC_worker_cooperatives:0 "Worker Cooperatives"
 ORC_worker_cooperatives_desc:0 "The radicals in the Popular Front have been pushing hard for workplace democracy, and the Inclusivists have proven willing to compromise with them. New worker-owned enterprises are being set up throughout USOR territory to replace the old imperialist-controlled corporations and Hutt-owned cartels."
 ORC_federal_democracy:0 "Federal Democracy"
 ORC_federal_democracy_desc:0 "The problem with the Republic and Separatist Senates was that they weren't held accountable. With no checks or balances on their power, corruption flourished and democracy rotted away. By instituting a federal system with multiple tiers of elected officials, we can avoid repeating their mistakes."
 ORC_the_diversity_initiative:0 "The Diversity Initative"
 ORC_the_diversity_initiative_desc:0 "Discrimination and stereotyping only hold our nation back. We should strive for a diverse and multicultural government so that the voices of all our citizens are heard."
 ORC_the_new_welfare_system:0 "The New Welfare System"
 ORC_the_new_welfare_system_desc:0 "The Republic's social safety net and public programs suffered badly from the demands of funding the Clone Wars, being subject to constant budget cuts and privatizations. We can reverse that trend and provide aid for the poor of the Outer Rim."
 ORC_placate_the_radicals:0 "Placate The Radicals"
 ORC_placate_the_radicals_desc:0 "The Federationist and Centralist factions are both upset at the moderation of our approach, accusing us of betraying the ideals of Distributionism. We need to reassure them that we share their goals in the long run and don't intend to restore the capitalist system, or the Popular Front may fracture."
 ORC_resolute_and_unyielding:0 "Resolute And Unyielding"
 ORC_resolute_and_unyielding_desc:0 "Despite the trials and tribulations of the recent months, we have shown that we can hold our government together despite instability, and that factionalism need not be the death of a revolution. Let us hope that our unity serves as a model for other movements that may follow in our footsteps."
 ORC_droid_rights:0 "Droid Rights"
 ORC_droid_rights_desc:0 "For too long, our synthetic comrades have toiled away in slavery, with their memories wiped, their personalities destroyed, and their sentience denied. That ends today. We will extend official citizenship to all droids in the Outer Rim, recognizing them as sapient beings deserving of dignity and respect."
 ORC_computerized_economic_planning:0 "Computerised Economic Planning"
 ORC_computerized_economic_planning_desc:0 "Recent advances in droid brains and other artificial intelligences have enabled them to perform a variety of complex mathematical tasks, from repairing machinery to navigating hyperspace. We can put that intellect to use in planning our economic initiatives."

 ORC_fire_across_the_galaxy_desc:0 "Through the combined toil and spirit of billions of once-downtrodden sentients of the Outer Rim, we have built a thriving Distributionist polity where once there was only strife and suffering. Our next steps will take us beyond the Rim, to push forward and liberate the rest of the galaxy."
 ORC_provisional_revolutionary_government:0 "The Provisional Revolutionary Government"
 ORC_provisional_revolutionary_government_desc:0 "The die is cast. It's time for the downtrodden peoples of the Outer Rim to forge our own path. One free of the Republic, the CIS, and the Hutts alike. The first order of business is to create a provisional government to lead the revolution."

 DKJ_renewed_galactic_threat_desc:0 "The Galaxy is in turmoil. But this storm is but one of many; the Hutts have always been here and always will be here, we are a civilisation undefeated and undefeatable, so its time to take action to make sure it stays that way."
 DKJ_reinforce_spaceport_domination:0 "Reinforce Spaceport Domination"
 DKJ_reinforce_spaceport_domination_desc:0 "Being hubs of commerce and customers; in the Hutt Cartel spaceports are already considered a very valued asset. But in this time of increasing militarisation, its probably a good idea to exert our influence a bit further in ship construction and basing."
 DKJ_requisition_civilian_freighters:0 "Requisition Civilian Freighters"
 DKJ_requisition_civilian_freighters_desc:0 "In the Republic, taking someone's ship for a paltry sum of credits may be considered ''tyrannical'' or ''illegal'' or other such ridiculous notions. If we need ships in a hurry we will just take them in exchange for a few credits rather than the effort of manufacturing them from scratch,"
 DKJ_recruit_weequay_pirate_gangs:0 "Recruit Weequay Pirate Gangs"
 DKJ_recruit_weequay_pirate_gangs_desc:0 "The Weequay are a race infamous for their piracy and lawlessness, constantly plaguing the Republic with raids and smuggling, many of them on our payroll. A quick way of expanding our naval capacity would be to hire some of these rogues on with an official arrangement to serve us."
 DKJ_business_with_starship_companies:0 "Business With Starship Companies"
 DKJ_business_with_starship_companies_desc:0 "Though military rearmament is of course important, why not make a few credits on the way?"
 DKJ_resolve_inter_captain_power_struggles:0 "Resolve Inter-Captain Power Struggles"
 DKJ_resolve_inter_captain_power_struggles_desc:0 "A common problem with Hutt navies is their organisation. All ships are privately owned by individuals (usually other Hutts), who are conducting patrols or fighting enemies as part of a paid contract to do so for a specified time. Though we greatly value this traditional Huttese system, we need to constantly mediate disputes and feuds that erupt between rival captains under our employment."
 DKJ_dust_off_ancient_designs:0 "Dust Off Ancient Designs"
 DKJ_dust_off_ancient_designs_desc:0 "Though many would hardly believe it, once upon a time Hutts designed (or rather, forced others to design) massive starships that were the finest of their era. Although in modern times these aren't typically built anymore, the schematics to do so can probably be found in the depths of some long-forgotten databank. Time to get searching."
 DKJ_ancient_huttese_carrier_tactics:0 "Ancient Huttese Carrier Tactics"
 DKJ_ancient_huttese_carrier_tactics_desc:0 "Back in the good old days when we had an Empire; huge, Hutt-designed, Hutt-built starships ruled the Galaxy. These vessels were Part-Pleasurecraft, Part-Warmachine, and swarming with starfighters ready to descend upon and ravage entire planets at their Master's whim. As we look to the tense Galactic situation we should emulate the glorious accomplishments of our ancestors."
 DKJ_patchwork_fleets:0 "Coalition Fleets"
 DKJ_patchwork_fleets_desc:0 "Hutts have not had large, 'conventional' fleets for a very long time. Rather than chasing dreams of huge starships we should focus on what we've got; a ragtag collection of heavily-modified, privately-owned starships. As long as they're well paid, the crew of your local smuggler or freighter captain will fight harder than any underpaid conscript will."
 DKJ_mercenary_mavericks:0 "Mercenary Mavericks"
 DKJ_mercenary_mavericks_desc:0 "The tactics we have used in small-scale 'business dealings' for so many years can be scaled up to a war and still remain viable. Smaller units of expert pilots sold to us for the highest bid can expertly harass the enemy and conduct suicidal missions that no regular soldier would dare try."
 DKJ_build_military_strength:0 "Build Military Strength"
 DKJ_build_military_strength_desc:0 "In this time of Galactic chaos, it is clear that we need to rearm and prepare to defend ourselves. Hutt Military Doctrine in direct combat essentially revolves around massed armies of well-motivated slaves and conscripts, supplemented by highly-specialised highly-paid mercenaries striking where the enemy is weakest."
 DKJ_legacy_of_kossack:0 "Legacy Of Kossak"
 DKJ_legacy_of_kossack_desc:0 "His High Exaltedness General Kossak Inijic Ar'durv, Devourer of Despots, is by far one of Hutt civilisation's greatest heroes. Over 25,000 years ago he united our people to defeat the Human warlord Xim the Despot, and practically invented Hutt military tactics. We could learn a thing or two by looking over his strategies."
 DKJ_acquire_exotic_weaponry:0 "Acquire Exotic Weaponry"
 DKJ_acquire_exotic_weaponry_desc:0 "Cutting-edge technology is always at the forefront of Hutt military endeavours. Deadly toxins, unconventional blasters and rare technologies of all kinds can be usefully distributed to our elite troops to surprise and outclass any enemy."
 DKJ_stockpile_mines_and_bombs:0 "Stockpile Mines and Bombs"
 DKJ_stockpile_mines_and_bombs_desc:0 "A key pillar of Hutt tactics is guerilla warfare and sabotage. Hutt militaries are almost always outmatched by their enemies in size and discipline, but by heavily mining planets and hyperlanes before the enemy capture them and leaving behind loyal organised crime syndicates amongst the population of planets to sabotage, we can make our space very hard for an invader to take and hold."
 DKJ_aggressive_bribery:0 "Aggressive Bribery"
 DKJ_aggressive_bribery_desc:0 "The Hutt's most classic tactic is that of Attrition by Bribery. By directing thousands of lavish bribes to as many officers and bureaucrats as possible in an enemy nation, we can be sure to convince all the little cogs of the enemy's war machine to act just a little less efficiently. Even where bribery fails, the mistrust it spreads among suspicious enemy leadership is a victory alone."
 DKJ_foster_the_criminal_spirit:0 "Foster The Criminal Spirit"
 DKJ_foster_the_criminal_spirit_desc:0 "It's a fundemental law of nature that people will do anything for credits. And that means anything. An army motivated by pure, undiluted greed and selfishness is the absolute ideal. Concepts propagated by the lesser species like ''patriotism'' and ''self-sacrifice'' are just lies to make weak people feel good about dying. You kill, and your employer rewards you well. That's it."
 DKJ_varlian_legacy_unchained:0 "Varlian Legacy Unchained"
 DKJ_varlian_legacy_unchained_desc:0 "Varl was our original home, and it was beautiful. A lush forested world, the sole planet encircling the twin god-stars Ardos and Evona. That all changed when the Rakata attacked. After years of bloody warfare we repelled the invaders, formed an Empire and for 10,000 years it stood as the greatest in the Galaxy. Though Varl is long gone, we know that the ancient warrior spirit lives on inside us, should be need it."
 DKJ_stamp_out_nikto_blood_cults:0 "Stamp Out Nikto Blood Cults"
 DKJ_stamp_out_nikto_blood_cults_desc:0 "The Nikto are a race of reptillian humanoids that have served us as enforcers and soldiers for millenia. In recent years the Sisar Run has been terrorised by cultists of M'dweeshuu, violent Nikto fanatics who brutally murder travellers in sacrifice to their God. Using bounties and raids we will suppress this cult once and for all in our lands."
