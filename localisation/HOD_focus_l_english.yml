 REP_the_war_economy:0 "The War Economy"
 REP_the_war_economy_desc:0 "With the Clone Wars upon us, the Republic must rapidly transition to a proper war economy. Thankfully, the legal precedent for transitioning to war economics has been recognized by the Senate. Together, victory will be achieved."
 REP_managing_the_manufacturing_sector:0 "Managing the Manufacturing Sector"
 REP_managing_the_manufacturing_sector_desc:0 "Despite the loss of several industrial centers to the Separatists, the Republic maintains a strong and massive manufacturing capability. However, it will need to be carefully managed to ensure the war is won."
 REP_blastech_contracts:0 "BlasTech Contracts"
 REP_blastech_contracts_desc:0 "BlasTech is one of the largest and most advanced arms manufacturers in the galaxy, and they have remained firmly in support of the Republic.

 REP_expanding_tech_factories_on_byblos:0 "Expanding Tech Factories on Byblos"
 REP_expanding_tech_factories_on_byblos_desc:0 "While home to criminals, Byblos is also home to BlasTech. As part of our investment in the company, the Chancellor has authorized funds be routed to Byblos' infrastucture and expansion of its factories. These will, of course, be BlasTech factories, benefitting the company and helping to provide work to the populace."
 REP_make_it_better:0 "Make It Better"
 REP_make_it_better_desc:0 "The Senate has agreed to a war economy, but the Chancellor, with his emergency powers, has the ability to help define what our industrial and economic ministers prioritize. The Chancellor has informed them to emphasize the quality of military supplies, cutting down on errors and improving functionality. Of course, this at the cost of speed."
 REP_make_it_faster:0 "Make It Faster"
 REP_make_it_faster_desc:0 "The Senate has agreed to a war economy, but the Chancellor, with his emergency powers, has the ability to help define what our industrial and economic ministers prioritize. The Chancellor has informed them to emphasize the speed of military supply production, hastening our ability to arm our troops and repair equipment. Of course, this at the cost of more errors and malfunctions."
 REP_expanding_the_refineries_on_bespin:0 "Expanding the Refineries on Bespin"
 REP_expanding_the_refineries_on_bespin_desc:0 "Bespin, and several worlds like it, are a primary source of blaster-gas, which is refined into the plasma-based ammunition for blasters. By expanding our refineries, we can produce more munitions."
 REP_the_might_of_balmora:0 "The Might of Balmorra"
 REP_the_might_of_balmora_desc:0 "For centuries Balmorra has stood as a bastion of the Republic's military productions. Despite private contracts, Balmorra has not lost that position. Its manufactories and industrial might is now being reawakened again, called into service. Granted designs for Clone Trooper armor and equipment, the might of Balmorra will be thrown at the Separatist menace!"
 REP_the_giant_awoken:0 "The Giant Awoken"
 REP_the_giant_awoken_desc:0 "Now that we have carefully arranged our manufacturing sector towards industries benefitting our military, a ripple effect has begun. New jobs and opportunities in these sectors have now driven their autonomous expansion, just as the Chancellor predicted. The full weight of the Republic Economy is now, directly or indirectly, fueling the war effort! Praise the Chancellor, and pass the ammunition!"
 REP_rothana_heavy_engineering_contracts:0 "Rothana Heavy Engineering Contracts"
 REP_rothana_heavy_engineering_contracts_desc:0 "Rothana Heavy Engineering is a subsidiary of Kuat Drive Yards, anda company that specializes in durable, powerful equipment, and has handed the development of several projects for the Kaminoans when they were first creating the Clone Army. It is only logical to contract them as the GRA's supplier of vehicles and heavy equipment."
 REP_streamlined_production_pipeline:0 "Streamlined Production Pipeline"
 REP_streamlined_production_pipeline_desc:0 "The military production pipeline, that is the development of new equipment and weapons in the stages of conceptualizing, designing, prototyping, and post-production updates, is choked by red tape under Republic law. The Chancellor has seen fit to remove this, allowing our best minds to be free of wait-times, multiple approval  signatures, and war crimes committees."
 REP_desperate_times:0 "Desperate Times"
 REP_desperate_times_desc:0 "The Republic has been a place of a free but well-regulated market. The indiviudal has been protected while a consumerist society has been encouraged. But we do not live in normal times. The economic culture of the Republic must adapt to the demands of war."
 REP_droid_reclamation_on_gyndine:0 "Droid Reclamation on Gyndine"
 REP_droid_reclamation_on_gyndine_desc:0 "The Separatists use droids en masse, and while we do not have a droid army, we have use for our own droids and the materials used to build them. To that end, the Chancellor has authorized the establishment of a Droid Reclamation Plant on the administrative planet of Gyndine. Private consumers may not like 'recycled' products, but they'll have to learn to embrace it."
 REP_nationalize_key_industries:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
 REP_nationalize_key_industries_desc:0 "The free market and private industry have supported the Republic for many centuries. But times are changing, and this a war unlike any the Republic has faced in a millennia. To ensure the security of critical industries, nationalization programs have been approved. The economists will gripe, but the Chancellor has assured them this is only temporary."
 REP_extreme_rationing:0 "Extreme Rationing"
 REP_extreme_rationing_desc:0 "The Emergency Rationing Act will allow military command to designate sector wide rationing of a variety goods, even food. This will help relief efforts and, of course, the army and navy. This will not be popular, but the temporary and rotating nature of rations will help alleviate discontent. Over time, our citizens will learn how to live in occassional scarcity. Perhaps they'll come to enjoy polystarch bread and veg-meat!"
 REP_droid_assisted_manufacturing:0 "Droid-Assisted Manufacturing"
 REP_droid_assisted_manufacturing_desc:0 "While the Republic has been careful to avoid fully automating assemblylines for the sake of jobs and to keep droids to domestic and military usage, we cannot afford to be so charitable. Droids can work all hours of the day, without pay, and so we will authorize the use of droids to supplement an existing workforce. Some menial jobs may be lost forever, but the war economy will open up new opportunities."
 REP_improved_restraining_bolts:0 "Improved Restraining Bolts"
 REP_improved_restraining_bolts_desc:0 "Droids our politicians, raise our children, tend our sick. Were the enemy to hack any droids, the Republic could be endangered. To that end, stricter restraining bolts will be developed, keeping droids obedient and less capable of independent thought. While some may complain this will negatively impact a droid's performance, but this should be a praised move overall."
 REP_total_war:0 "Total War"
 REP_total_war_desc:0 "The concept of total war economic mobilization is not new, but not one the general public or the Senate will like. However, it may be needed. The Chancellor has authorized a secret protocol to begin guiding the private sector and nationalized industries towards total war economics to make its officializing a formality."
 REP_desperate_measures:0 "Desperate Measures"
 REP_desperate_measures_desc:0 "We live in extraordinary times, and we have begun shifting the economy to adjust. Adjustment to scarcity and recycling, and patriotic support for nationalization are begin to take affect. The economy is ready for war, and soon our citizens will be too."
 REP_control_the_banks:0 "Control the Banks"
 REP_control_the_banks_desc:0 "The loyalty of the Banking Clans are divided and dubious. It is only logical to begin getting the banks under government control. THe clans will complain, but their wealth will not be impacted. The economy, however, will be safer under direct government regulation."
 REP_longer_hours:0 "Longer Hours"
 REP_longer_hours_desc:0 "The Republic's labor laws are centuries old, and not suited to war time. While automation is more polific, we need citizens giving their all to the war effort. Employees will now be allowed to 'volunteer' to work longer hours for patriotic employers."
 REP_lower_pay:0 "Lower Pay"
 REP_lower_pay_desc:0 "Everyone deserves a living wage, but we currently are in a life or death situation. With greater scarcity and war economics, people need less as it is, and as such we will lower the minimum wage, allowing more money saved from government jobs, and more investment from private employers."
 REP_contacts_in_kuat:0 "Contacts in Kuat"
 REP_contacts_in_kuat_desc:0 "Kuat Drive Yards has been making top-of-the-line ships for a long time. The Republic has not had need for their services en masse before, but they have supplied planetary militias before, and they have remained loyal to the Republic. We will reach out to them and gain beneficial deals on war-ship production."
 REP_expanding_the_shipyards_on_kuat:0 "Expanding the Shipyards on Kuat"
 REP_expanding_the_shipyards_on_kuat_desc:0 "Nothing is done for free. If we expect Kuat Drive Yards to supply ships for the Republic, it is only fair we invest in them. To that end, the best idea is to fund expansion of their shipping yards. After all, this ultimately aids the Republic as much it does the company."
 REP_all_must_give:0 "All Must Give"
 REP_all_must_give_desc:0 "While the Republic has a large economy, tax revenue is not as high as it could be. By cutting tax breaks, non-essential welfare programs, and a general war tax on goods, we can help fund the war effort with ease! People may complain, but we all have to do our part, voluntarily or not."
 REP_a_guiding_hand:0 "Guiding Hand"
 REP_a_guiding_hand_desc:0 "Regulations have been a long-time cornerstone of Republic economics, caring for the individual and ensuring safety.

Government inspectors will be authorized to investigate company practices to keep them in-line with new regulations."
 REP_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
 REP_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "With traitors everywhere, trust is hard to find.

This now includes ensuring loyalty within unions and corporations that members are a part of."
 REP_wartime_relief_efforts:0 "Wartime Relief Efforts"
 REP_wartime_relief_efforts_desc:0 "We are funding the war effort well, and still have a steady budget. The Chancellor has proposed a small tax bump and the slashing of smaller government programs to fund relief efforts, giving subsidy to those impacted personally by the war. It may be pricey, but it will be a very popular program. And public support is crucial a civil war, after all."
 REP_total_control:0 "Total Control"
 REP_total_control_desc:0 "The recent reforms we have passed have given the Chancellor, and thus the Republic, firm control over its civilian economy. The banks and markets are safe, people are working more for less, and Separatist influence in the civilian sector is shrinking. As an added bonus, this has demonstrated to the public that total control means stability and safety!"

 REP_the_military_creation_act:0 "The Military Creation Act"
 REP_the_military_creation_act_desc:0 "The amassing Droid Armies of the Separatists far outnumber the Jedi. In order to ensure the Republic has a fighting chance in the impending war, we must allow the creation of a Grand Army of the Republic immediately."

 REP_the_battle_of_geonosis_desc:0 "Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Amidala have been captured on Geonosis! The Separatists are planning on executing them.

 REP_amidala_the_martyr:0 "Amidala The Martyr"
 REP_amidala_the_martyr_desc:0 "Already, Padmé Amidala has become a symbol of the Republic and Anti-Separatism. We ought to encourage this. Not only are the Separatists a gang of corrupt corporatists and opportunists — the kind of scum Amidala fought against — but she always stood for unity.

 REP_peace_was_never_an_option:0 "Peace Was Never An Option"
 REP_peace_was_never_an_option_desc:0 "As the war continues, we have come to a realization: we can never live in peace while the Separatists survive. Negotiating peace will set a dangerous precedent, and allow traitors to reinfiltrate us. As of now, we know our enemies. They have outed themselves, and stand in our cross-hairs. We must not let them slip back into the shadows! We must march to eradicate all Separatist traitors!"

Old friends now have prominence in the CIS and amongst the late Sidious' favor, and these ties could be leveraged to secure Amedda some desperately needed victories for the Republic. For the right price, of course."
 REP_voice_of_the_emperor:0 "Voice of the Emperor"
 REP_voice_of_the_emperor_desc:0 "Mas Amedda is known for three things: his loyalty to Palpatine, his obsession with procedure, and his booming voice. Few will be able to interrupt him, he will throw every by-law and rule on record at his opponents. As his words shout them down, red tape will choke them out."
 REP_false_war:0 "False War"
 REP_false_war_desc:0 "Chancellor Amedda has contacted his fellow servants of Sidious amongst the Separatists. With their master gone, a new opportunity arises; to keep the war endless and ongoing, lining pockets with wealth and furthering political power. Every so often, a battle lost, fear risen, then hope gained with a thrilling assault. All according to plan."
 REP_man_behind_the_curtain:0 "The Man Behind Curtain"
 REP_man_behind_the_curtain_desc:0 "Mas Amedda may be Chancellor, but he is nothing without Sate Pestage, Palpatine's oldest aide and confidant. The conniving emmisary is key to keeping Amedda's plans on track, pulling all the strings needed. But at what point does the puppeteer's patron become but another puppet?"
 REP_fostering_palpatines_legacy:0 "Fostering Palpatine's Legacy"
 REP_fostering_palpatines_legacy_desc:0 "Key to Chancellor Amedda's ambitions of personal power is keeping the veneration of Palpatine alive. Monuments will be erected, portraits hung and quotations engraved, his name memoralized on hospitals and offices. No one will forget the Great Sheev Palpatine. And no one will forget that Amedda and his cohort at the torchbearers of his legacy, with an empire built in his memory."
 REP_working_in_the_shadows:0 "Working in the Shadows"
 REP_working_in_the_shadows_desc:0 "Pestage has handled the Senate and Amedda has taken care of the public. The military, however, remains difficult to control. The solution? Armand Isard. Another of Sidious' circle, and a genius spymaster. As the third of the new triumvirate, he will keep the military in line with his network of operatives and pseudo-commissars."
 REP_fear_and_guile:0 "Fear and Guile"
 REP_fear_and_guile_desc:0 "There is still much work to be done. However, the Secret Empire is already forming, fueled by a masterfully planned war. Fear will keep the people obedient, and guile will leverage the elite to Amedda, Pestage, and Isard's will. A toast to the Republic! And to the Empire growing under its skin!"
 REP_emergency_government:0 "The Emergency Government"
 REP_emergency_government_desc:0 "No one has gained a majority vote in the Senate. The failed candidates' support bases have fractured, but the Republic needs firm leadership. The Admiralty has decided to act; a military committee will command of the executive branch, until a new Chancellor is agreed on. No one man shall rule, and the measures are temporary. But there is a war to win."
 REP_dauntless_to_domination:0 "Dauntless to Domination"
 REP_dauntless_to_domination_desc:0 "Now that the Executive Committee has been created, the war must be prioritized over politics. New ships are part of that, along with the dismissal of all regulations needed for fleets to enter any part of Republic space. Our ships shall go where they please, and are needed."
 REP_a_stronger_order:0 "A Stronger Order"
 REP_a_stronger_order_desc:0 "The Executive Committee is meant to be temporary, but its membership is in agreement that this is a chance to improve the weakened Republic. Militarism must be strengthened, alongside strong devotion to the rule of law. A new, stronger order will be forged in the time we have."
 REP_managing_the_populace:0 "Managing the Populace"
 REP_managing_the_populace_desc: "There has been surprising backlash to the creation of the Executive Committee. We must work to improve its popularity, playing to militarist and Unitist sentiments. There is also a proposal to leak false stories and stage a few victimless events to improve public opinion. These plans will be approved."
 REP_placate_rivalries:0 "Placate Rivalries"
 REP_placate_rivalries_desc:0 "The Executive Committee was established to overcome political infighting. However, factions have formed; old guard traditionalists under Admiral Yularen, and Unitist radicals rally behind the newly promoted Admiral Tarkin. Neither has the upperhand, but the two sides have come to a temporary understanding, at least while the Committee is cementing its grasp."
 REP_foment_fanatacism:0 "Foment Fanaticism"
 REP_foment_fanatacism_desc:0 "The only way to prevent the growth of Separatists and other traitors in the present and future is to ensure the fanatic loyalty of the average citizen matches a soldiers. New propaganda and education reforms will help cure the public of disloyalty. Soon, traitors will have nowhere to hide."
 REP_one_state_one_galaxy:0 "One State, One Galaxy"
 REP_one_state_one_galaxy_desc:0 "Core, Outer-Rim, these labels are irrelvant. As is the line between 'neutral' and traitor. The Galaxy is the natural dominion of the Republic. All its systems will be reunited. One State! One People! One Galaxy!"
 REP_law_and_order:0 "Law and Order"
 REP_law_and_order_desc:0 "The job of the Executive Committee has only just begun. The Senate is still disjointed, and support for the military's actions are growing as a result. A popular mandate will soon be ours, one to create a Republic that venerates Law and Order above all else."

 CIS_peace_is_a_lie2:0 "Peace is a Lie, There is Only Passion"
 CIS_peace_is_a_lie2_desc:0 "Casting aside his former name of Dooku, Darth Tyranus has fully embraced the way of the Sith. Now begins the momentous work of reforging the CIS into an empire truly worthy of the heir to the Dark Side."
 CIS_the_future_of_the_dark_side:0 "The Future of the Dark Side"
 CIS_the_future_of_the_dark_side_desc:0 "The first, and most important, decision that Tyranus must make is simple to state but very difficult to answer: what is to be done with the Rule of Two? Will he abide by the iron law of Bane or remake the Sith in his own image?"
 CIS_always_two:0 "Always Two, There Are"
 CIS_always_two_desc:0 "The Sith Empires of the past collapsed into infighting because the power of the Dark Side was spread too thin, placed in too many hands. The Rule of Two must be maintained so that the will of the Sith remains uncontested."
 CIS_betrayal_is_the_sith_way:0 "Betrayal is the Sith Way"
 CIS_betrayal_is_the_sith_way_desc:0 "Darth Sidious is furious at the creation of the new Sith Empire, but his rage means nothing. If he is incapable of dealing with treachery, he is unworthy of the mantle of Dark Lord. It is time to make the final break from his control: Tyranus must take an apprentice of his own."
 CIS_his_loyal_right_hand:0 "His 'Loyal' Right Hand"
 CIS_his_loyal_right_hand_desc:0 "Asajj Ventress has already been training in the ways of the Sith for years. With Sidious no longer in command, there is no need for any further subterfuge about Tyranus's intentions for her. It is time to make her a Sith Lord in name as well as in fact."
 CIS_the_prodigal_daughter:0 "The Prodigal Daughter"
 CIS_the_prodigal_daughter_desc:0 "Ventress has fled, swearing vengeance on Tyranus and anyone who aids him. But there is no sense in dwelling now on the training that went to waste, or scenarios that might have been--it is time to consider alternative options."
 CIS_continue_her_training:0 "Continue Her Training"
 CIS_continue_her_training_desc:0 "Ventress has been trained well: besides Tyranus himself, only the greatest of Jedi can surpass her skill with lightsabers or the Force. Now that she can train openly, it is time to intensify her trials to prepare her for the role of a Sith apprentice."
 CIS_confirm_her_allegiance:0 "Confirm Her Allegiance"
 CIS_confirm_her_allegiance_desc:0 "Despite the promise she shows, Ventress has displayed signs of disloyalty in the past--not just to Dooku, but to the Dark Side itself. Obviously, this is unacceptable; she must be brought in line before her apprenticeship can go forward."
 CIS_demand_her_obedience:0 "Demand Her Obedience"
 CIS_demand_her_obedience_desc:0 "A commitment to the Dark Side may be necessary for Ventress to achieve her destiny, but it is not sufficient. She must obey Tyranus in all things...at least, until the time is ripe for her to overthrow him."
 CIS_seek_a_new_apprentice:0 "Seek a New Apprentice"
 CIS_seek_a_new_apprentice_desc:0 "Fortunately, Ventress is not the only person in the galaxy who is strong in the Dark Side. Several other plausible candidates for a new apprentice have presented themselves--but only one will rise to the vaunted title of "Darth"."
 CIS_the_renegade:0 "The Renegade"
 CIS_the_renegade_desc:0 "Quinlan Vos abandoned the weakness of the Jedi during an attempt to assassinate Tyranus. His hatred for his master will fuel his dark powers, always a desirable quality in a Sith apprentice."
 CIS_the_butcher:0 "The Butcher"
 CIS_the_butcher_desc:0 "Pong Krell proved his worth with a brutal massacre of clones on Umbara. His contempt for the weakness of his inferiors could become the core principle of a new Sith Lord under Tyranus's tutelage."
 CIS_the_ideologue:0 "The Ideologue"
 CIS_the_ideologue_desc:0 "Barriss Offee turned against the Jedi Order late in the war, committing multiple terrorist attacks and framing her former friend Ahsoka Tano for her actions. With the proper training, she could be reforged into an exemplary Sith."
 CIS_the_outsider:0 "The Outsider"
 CIS_the_outsider_desc:0 "Savage Oppress was once Ventress's ally in her vendetta against Tyranus, but he can serve the dark side better as a new Sith apprentice. Forcing him to submit to Tyranus's will is bound to be no easy task, but it will be worthwhile nonetheless."
 CIS_break_him_down: "Break Him Down"
 CIS_break_him_down_desc:0 "To ensure that there is no chance of the light reasserting itself in Vos, all vestiges of his former identity must be destroyed by any means necessary. It will be a painful process, to say the least--but his suffering will only make him stronger."
 CIS_encourage_his_bloodlust:0 "Encourage His Bloodlust"
 CIS_encourage_his_bloodlust_desc:0 "Krell is a being who takes joy in slaughter, for whom the suffering and death of his foes is its own reward. Bringing this quality to the forefront of his psyche will strengthen his connection to the Dark Side."
 CIS_twist_her_morals:0 "Twist Her Morals"
 CIS_twist_her_morals_desc:0 "Unlike the other potential apprentices, Offee still clings to a misguided sense of "morality". But, while unfortunate, this weakness is not insurmountable. She must simply be...convinced...that the only way to accomplish her goals is to set those fetters aside."
 CIS_alter_his_body:0 "Alter His Body"
 CIS_alter_his_body_desc:0 "Oppress is a titanic being with immense strength and durability, but it is not in the nature of the Sith to be satisfied with any amount of power, no matter how great. With sorcery and cybernetics Oppress's form can be enhanced even further...while making him dependent on his Master."
 CIS_build_him_anew:0 "Build Him Anew"
 CIS_build_him_anew_desc:0 "Once his Jedi origins have been consigned to oblivion, Vos must be reeducated and indoctrinated into Sith philosophy. His fragile mind can be molded by the superior power of Tyranus, making him an utterly fanatical devotee of the Dark Side."
 CIS_rise_darth_enigma:0 "Rise, Darth Enigma"
 CIS_rise_darth_enigma_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Quinlan Vos is no more. In his place rises Darth Enigma, a being of pure hatred. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall annihilate their foes."
 CIS_feed_his_malice:0 "Feed His Malice"
 CIS_feed_his_malice_desc:0 "The unique combination of cunning, brute force, and utter lack of compassion or empathy that enabled Krell to trick the 501st and 212th into murdering many of their own men is impressive for one so new to the Dark Side. He must be taught to develop and rely on those skills."
 CIS_rise_darth_lanius:0 "Rise, Darth Lanius"
 CIS_rise_darth_lanius_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Pong Krell is no more. In his place rises Darth Lanius, a remorseless slayer of the weak. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall make the galaxy bleed."
 CIS_nurture_her_rage:0 "Nurture Her Rage"
 CIS_nurture_her_rage_desc:0 "Offee carries a deep, vicious fury at the Jedi and their allies, and desires revenge on them at any cost. These emotions should be encouraged and strengthened in order to push her further down the path of the Sith."
 CIS_rise_darth_abyssal:0 "Rise, Darth Abyssal"
 CIS_rise_darth_abyssal_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Barriss Offee is no more. In her place rises Darth Abyssal, determined to reshape the galaxy in her image. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall reign supreme."
 CIS_corrupt_his_mind:0 "Corrupt His Mind"
 CIS_corrupt_his_mind_desc:0 "Oppress's attachments to his ally Ventress and his brother Maul are a weakness--and worse still, a weakness that can be used against not just him, but Tyranus as well. If he is to be an effective apprentice, he must come to despise all those he once fought alongside."
 CIS_rise_darth_irae:0 "Rise, Darth Irae"
 CIS_rise_darth_irae_desc:0 "Savage Oppress is no more. In his place rises Darth Irae, a wrathful force of destruction. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall crush all opposition."
 CIS_rise_darth_umbral:0 "Rise, Darth Umbral"
 CIS_rise_darth_umbral_desc:0 "Asajj Ventress is no more. In her place rises Darth Umbral, the first acolyte of darkness. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall rise again, stronger than ever before."

 #OUTER RIM COMMONWEALTH#
 ORC_the_congress_of_mos_espa:0 "The Congress Of Mos Espa"
 ORC_the_congress_of_mos_espa_desc:0 "The Outer Rim's war of independence has been won, but our struggle must go on. To that end, it is time to replace the Provisional Government. Democratically-elected delegates from all over our territory are coming together in Mos Espa to determine the future of the Outer Rim."
 ORC_the_communal_federation_of_outer_rim:0 "The Communal Federation Of The Outer Rim" 
 ORC_the_communal_federation_of_outer_rim_desc:0 "The Federationists have emerged victorious in the Mos Espa Congress. In accordance with their vision, the new government of the Outer Rim will be highly decentralized, run by workers' councils and local communes."
 ORC_the_conquest_of_portions:0 "The Conquest Of Portions"
 ORC_the_conquest_of_portions_desc:0 "The seeds of a free and equal society are already present in the decentralized revolutionary organizations that formed in the years preceding the rebellion, such as the Sullustan unions or the Tatooine freedom trails. Instead of dissolving these groups, we should formalize them as the nucleus of a new government."
 ORC_mutual_aid:0 "Mutual Aid"
 ORC_mutual_aid_desc:0 "Every good Distributionist knows that we are at our strongest when we stand in solidarity with our fellow sentients. By sending representatives to talk to local leaders across the Rim, we can make sure that our comrades don't suffer for lack of resources or personnel."
 ORC_community_self-defense:0 "Community Self-Defense"
 ORC_community_self-defense_desc:0 "Lacking a strong central government doesn't have to mean that we can't protect ourselves and defend the revolution. By retaining the local militias that were raised during the rebellion, we can set up a first line of defense against invasion."
 ORC_social_liberation:0 "Social Liberation"
 ORC_social_liberation_desc:0 "True equality cannot be achieved while even the smallest remnant persists of the oppressive and hierarchical power structures that once held us down. We will therefore campaign across the Outer Rim against all types of bigotry and prejudice, so that all of our citizens can have an equal share in the new revolutionary order."
 ORC_wretched_hives_no_more:0 ""Wretched Hives" No More"
 ORC_wretched_hives_no_more_desc:0 "For centuries, the Outer Rim has been host to all manner of criminal activity. Spice addiction, human trafficking, and extortion run rampant even now. Without a powerful state to combat such problems, it is imperative that the communes work together to clean up the frontier."
 ORC_we_love_direct_democracy:0 "We Love (Direct) Democracy"
 ORC_we_love_direct_democracy_desc:0 "Democratic governance is crucial to a free society. But unlike the "democracy" of the Republic or Separatist Senate, we understand the importance of putting the people first. We must promote direct democracy so that citizens will have a voice in the issues most important to their lives."
 ORC_municipal_development:0 "Municipal Development"
 ORC_municipal_development_desc:0 "Despite the rapid industrialization that took place during the war, large swathes of the Outer Rim are still undeveloped and poor. A wave of new local infrastructure and development projects will make the communes more self-sufficient and prosperous."
 ORC_rebellions_are_built_on_hope:0 "Rebellions Are Built On Hope"
 ORC_rebellions_are_built_on_hope_desc:0 "We still have a long way to go, but we have proven that our objective is more than a pipe dream. The results we've produced in just a few short months will rally more people to our cause and raise the morale of our own loyal supporters."
 ORC_the_galactic_frontier_state:0 "The Galactic Frontier State"
 ORC_the_galactic_frontier_state_desc:0 "The Centralists have carried the day in Mos Espa. Their program calls for a mass mobilization of the people of the Outer Rim for a continuing struggle against imperialism and reactionary ideology."
 ORC_political_power_flows_from_the_barrel_of_a_blaster:0 "Political Power Flows From The Barrel Of A Blaster"
 ORC_political_power_flows_from_the_barrel_of_a_blaster_desc:0 "The recent victory of the Distributionist forces marks only the first stage of the revolutionary struggle. We shall continue it into the future by inducting the leaders of the mass popular uprisings into our party. Their connections to the masses will allow us to remain in tune with the needs of our power base."
 ORC_the_cultural_revolution:0 "The Cultural Revolution"
 ORC_the_cultural_revolution_desc:0 "It is the responsibility of a Distributionist state to continue the class struggle at any cost. Every available resource must be committed to stomping out reactionaryism, landlordism, and imperialist ideology."
 ORC_green_guards:0 "Green Guards"
 ORC_green_guards_desc:0 "The most devoted Distributionists among our people are forming "Green Guard" cells to show their commitment to our ideals. We should encourage this in order to create a loyal and ideologically correct source of support amongst the wider population."
 ORC_continue_the_drive_to_industrialise:0 "Continue The Drive To Industralise"
 ORC_continue_the_drive_to_industrialise_desc:0 "We have made sweeping progress over the course of the war in transforming the Outer Rim from an exploited frontier region to an advanced modern state. But our work is not yet done. Maintaining the rapid growth of our heavy industry is necessary for our long-term goals."
 ORC_resistance_is_not_terrorism:0 "Resistance Is Not Terrorism"
 ORC_resistance_is_not_terrorism_desc:0 "While they may have been necessary to liberate us from the imperialists, the ruthless tactics of our faction have alienated many of the Federationists and moderates. We should try to rally them back to our side with a propaganda campaign."
 ORC_distributionist_internationalism:0 "Distributionist Internationalism"
 ORC_distributionist_internationalism_desc:0 "Our commitment to Distributionism must reach beyond our borders. Workers suffer under corporate exploitation not just in the Outer Rim, but all across the galaxy. We should reach out to other Distributionist parties to begin setting up a truly galactic movement."
 ORC_expand_the_party:0 "Expand The Party"
 ORC_expand_the_party_desc:0 "With a vast territory to govern and only a small cadre of committed Centralists with which to do it, it is clear that it has become necessary to fill out the lower ranks of our party and bring fresh faces into the fold. In short, we need to launch an Outer-Rim-wide recruitment campaign."
 ORC_we_are_the_spark:0 "We Are The Spark"
 ORC_we_are_the_spark_desc:0 "As the first true Distributionist state in the galaxy, it is our task to lead the revolution by example. Our success will inspire workers across the galaxy to rise up and throw off their shackles, for where there is oppression, there is revolt."
 ORC_the_united_systems_of_the_outer_rim:0 "The United System Of The Outer Rim"
 ORC_the_united_systems_of_the_outer_rim_desc:0 "With no consensus being reached at the Congress of Mos Espa, a Popular Front has been formed to ensure stability. However, the fragmentation of the main factions has enabled the Inclusivists to demand concessions."
 ORC_our_property_our_honour_our_lives:0 "Our Property, Our Honour, Our Lives"
 ORC_our_property_our_honour_our_lives_desc:0 "The Popular Front is shaky at best, but we can shore it up by bringing the Inclusivists on board. This will limit our ability to pursue radical goals, but it may win us some support from more moderate groups among our population, especially in developed ex-Republic worlds like Rodia and Christophsis."
 ORC_state-owned_enterprise:0 "State-Owned Enterprise"
 ORC_state-owned_enterprise_desc:0 "The Distributionist idea of seizing the means of production can be accomplished by putting crucial industries and economic sectors under the control of a democratically-elected government. We will nationalize industry to remove the profit motive from the equation."
 ORC_worker_cooperatives:0 "Worker Cooperatives"
 ORC_worker_cooperatives_desc:0 "The radicals in the Popular Front have been pushing hard for workplace democracy, and the Inclusivists have proven willing to compromise with them. New worker-owned enterprises are being set up throughout USOR territory to replace the old imperialist-controlled corporations and Hutt-owned cartels."
 ORC_federal_democracy:0 "Federal Democracy"
 ORC_federal_democracy_desc:0 "The problem with the Republic and Separatist Senates was that they weren't held accountable. With no checks or balances on their power, corruption flourished and democracy rotted away. By instituting a federal system with multiple tiers of elected officials, we can avoid repeating their mistakes."
 ORC_the_diversity_initiative:0 "The Diversity Initative"
 ORC_the_diversity_initiative_desc:0 "Discrimination and stereotyping only hold our nation back. We should strive for a diverse and multicultural government so that the voices of all our citizens are heard."
 ORC_the_new_welfare_system:0 "The New Welfare System"
 ORC_the_new_welfare_system_desc:0 "The Republic's social safety net and public programs suffered badly from the demands of funding the Clone Wars, being subject to constant budget cuts and privatizations. We can reverse that trend and provide aid for the poor of the Outer Rim."
 ORC_placate_the_radicals:0 "Placate The Radicals"
 ORC_placate_the_radicals_desc:0 "The Federationist and Centralist factions are both upset at the moderation of our approach, accusing us of betraying the ideals of Distributionism. We need to reassure them that we share their goals in the long run and don't intend to restore the capitalist system, or the Popular Front may fracture."
 ORC_resolute_and_unyielding:0 "Resolute And Unyielding"
 ORC_resolute_and_unyielding_desc:0 "Despite the trials and tribulations of the recent months, we have shown that we can hold our government together despite instability, and that factionalism need not be the death of a revolution. Let us hope that our unity serves as a model for other movements that may follow in our footsteps."
 ORC_droid_rights:0 "Droid Rights"
 ORC_droid_rights_desc:0 "For too long, our synthetic comrades have toiled away in slavery, with their memories wiped, their personalities destroyed, and their sentience denied. That ends today. We will extend official citizenship to all droids in the Outer Rim, recognizing them as sapient beings deserving of dignity and respect."
 ORC_computerized_economic_planning:0 "Computerised Economic Planning"
 ORC_computerized_economic_planning_desc:0 "Recent advances in droid brains and other artificial intelligences have enabled them to perform a variety of complex mathematical tasks, from repairing machinery to navigating hyperspace. We can put that intellect to use in planning our economic initiatives."
 ORC_fire_across_the_galaxy:0 "Fire Across The Galaxy"
 ORC_fire_across_the_galaxy_desc:0 "Through the combined toil and spirit of billions of once-downtrodden sentients of the Outer Rim, we have built a thriving Distributionist polity where once there was only strife and suffering. Our next steps will take us beyond the Rim, to push forward and liberate the rest of the galaxy."
 ORC_provisional_revolutionary_government:0 "The Provisional Revolutionary Government"
 ORC_provisional_revolutionary_government_desc:0 "The die is cast. It's time for the downtrodden peoples of the Outer Rim to forge our own path. One free of the Republic, the CIS, and the Hutts alike. The first order of business is to create a provisional government to lead the revolution."

 DKJ_renewed_galactic_threat:0 "Renewed Galactic Threat"
 DKJ_renewed_galactic_threat_desc:0 "The Galaxy is in turmoil. But this storm is but one of many; the Hutts have always been here and always will be here, we are a civilisation undefeated and undefeatable, so its time to take action to make sure it stays that way."
 DKJ_reinforce_spaceport_domination:0 "Reinforce Spaceport Domination"
 DKJ_reinforce_spaceport_domination_desc:0 "Being hubs of commerce and customers; in the Hutt Cartel spaceports are already considered a very valued asset. But in this time of increasing militarisation, its probably a good idea to exert our influence a bit further in ship construction and basing."
 DKJ_requisition_civilian_freighters:0 "Requisition Civilian Freighters"
 DKJ_requisition_civilian_freighters_desc:0 "In the Republic, taking someone's ship for a paltry sum of credits may be considered ''tyrannical'' or ''illegal'' or other such ridiculous notions. If we need ships in a hurry we will just take them in exchange for a few credits rather than the effort of manufacturing them from scratch,"
 DKJ_recruit_weequay_pirate_gangs:0 "Recruit Weequay Pirate Gangs"
 DKJ_recruit_weequay_pirate_gangs_desc:0 "The Weequay are a race infamous for their piracy and lawlessness, constantly plaguing the Republic with raids and smuggling, many of them on our payroll. A quick way of expanding our naval capacity would be to hire some of these rogues on with an official arrangement to serve us."
 DKJ_business_with_starship_companies:0 "Business With Starship Companies"
 DKJ_business_with_starship_companies_desc:0 "Though military rearmament is of course important, why not make a few credits on the way?"
 DKJ_resolve_inter_captain_power_struggles:0 "Resolve Inter-Captain Power Struggles"
 DKJ_resolve_inter_captain_power_struggles_desc:0 "A common problem with Hutt navies is their organisation. All ships are privately owned by individuals (usually other Hutts), who are conducting patrols or fighting enemies as part of a paid contract to do so for a specified time. Though we greatly value this traditional Huttese system, we need to constantly mediate disputes and feuds that erupt between rival captains under our employment."
 DKJ_dust_off_ancient_designs:0 "Dust Off Ancient Designs"
 DKJ_dust_off_ancient_designs_desc:0 "Though many would hardly believe it, once upon a time Hutts designed (or rather, forced others to design) massive starships that were the finest of their era. Although in modern times these aren't typically built anymore, the schematics to do so can probably be found in the depths of some long-forgotten databank. Time to get searching."
 DKJ_ancient_huttese_carrier_tactics:0 "Ancient Huttese Carrier Tactics"
 DKJ_ancient_huttese_carrier_tactics_desc:0 "Back in the good old days when we had an Empire; huge, Hutt-designed, Hutt-built starships ruled the Galaxy. These vessels were Part-Pleasurecraft, Part-Warmachine, and swarming with starfighters ready to descend upon and ravage entire planets at their Master's whim. As we look to the tense Galactic situation we should emulate the glorious accomplishments of our ancestors."
 DKJ_patchwork_fleets:0 "Coalition Fleets"
 DKJ_patchwork_fleets_desc:0 "Hutts have not had large, 'conventional' fleets for a very long time. Rather than chasing dreams of huge starships we should focus on what we've got; a ragtag collection of heavily-modified, privately-owned starships. As long as they're well paid, the crew of your local smuggler or freighter captain will fight harder than any underpaid conscript will."
 DKJ_mercenary_mavericks:0 "Mercenary Mavericks"
 DKJ_mercenary_mavericks_desc:0 "The tactics we have used in small-scale 'business dealings' for so many years can be scaled up to a war and still remain viable. Smaller units of expert pilots sold to us for the highest bid can expertly harass the enemy and conduct suicidal missions that no regular soldier would dare try."
 DKJ_build_military_strength:0 "Build Military Strength"
 DKJ_build_military_strength_desc:0 "In this time of Galactic chaos, it is clear that we need to rearm and prepare to defend ourselves. Hutt Military Doctrine in direct combat essentially revolves around massed armies of well-motivated slaves and conscripts, supplemented by highly-specialised highly-paid mercenaries striking where the enemy is weakest."
 DKJ_legacy_of_kossack:0 "Legacy Of Kossak"
 DKJ_legacy_of_kossack_desc:0 "His High Exaltedness General Kossak Inijic Ar'durv, Devourer of Despots, is by far one of Hutt civilisation's greatest heroes. Over 25,000 years ago he united our people to defeat the Human warlord Xim the Despot, and practically invented Hutt military tactics. We could learn a thing or two by looking over his strategies."
 DKJ_acquire_exotic_weaponry:0 "Acquire Exotic Weaponry"
 DKJ_acquire_exotic_weaponry_desc:0 "Cutting-edge technology is always at the forefront of Hutt military endeavours. Deadly toxins, unconventional blasters and rare technologies of all kinds can be usefully distributed to our elite troops to surprise and outclass any enemy."
 DKJ_stockpile_mines_and_bombs:0 "Stockpile Mines and Bombs"
 DKJ_stockpile_mines_and_bombs_desc:0 "A key pillar of Hutt tactics is guerilla warfare and sabotage. Hutt militaries are almost always outmatched by their enemies in size and discipline, but by heavily mining planets and hyperlanes before the enemy capture them and leaving behind loyal organised crime syndicates amongst the population of planets to sabotage, we can make our space very hard for an invader to take and hold."
 DKJ_aggressive_bribery:0 "Aggressive Bribery"
 DKJ_aggressive_bribery_desc:0 "The Hutt's most classic tactic is that of Attrition by Bribery. By directing thousands of lavish bribes to as many officers and bureaucrats as possible in an enemy nation, we can be sure to convince all the little cogs of the enemy's war machine to act just a little less efficiently. Even where bribery fails, the mistrust it spreads among suspicious enemy leadership is a victory alone."
 DKJ_foster_the_criminal_spirit:0 "Foster The Criminal Spirit"
 DKJ_foster_the_criminal_spirit_desc:0 "It's a fundemental law of nature that people will do anything for credits. And that means anything. An army motivated by pure, undiluted greed and selfishness is the absolute ideal. Concepts propagated by the lesser species like ''patriotism'' and ''self-sacrifice'' are just lies to make weak people feel good about dying. You kill, and your employer rewards you well. That's it."
 DKJ_varlian_legacy_unchained:0 "Varlian Legacy Unchained"
 DKJ_varlian_legacy_unchained_desc:0 "Varl was our original home, and it was beautiful. A lush forested world, the sole planet encircling the twin god-stars Ardos and Evona. That all changed when the Rakata attacked. After years of bloody warfare we repelled the invaders, formed an Empire and for 10,000 years it stood as the greatest in the Galaxy. Though Varl is long gone, we know that the ancient warrior spirit lives on inside us, should be need it."
 DKJ_stamp_out_nikto_blood_cults:0 "Stamp Out Nikto Blood Cults"
 DKJ_stamp_out_nikto_blood_cults_desc:0 "The Nikto are a race of reptillian humanoids that have served us as enforcers and soldiers for millenia. In recent years the Sisar Run has been terrorised by cultists of M'dweeshuu, violent Nikto fanatics who brutally murder travellers in sacrifice to their God. Using bounties and raids we will suppress this cult once and for all in our lands."
 DKJ_raise_the_vodran_serfs:0 "Raise The Vodran Serfs"
 DKJ_raise_the_vodran_serfs_desc:0 "Vodrans are our oldest and most loyal slave species. After their legendary leader Kl'ieutu Mutela signed away his whole species to permenant servitude, Vontor culture was totally supplanted by Huttese civilisation. In this time of growing uncertainty, we should begin to recruit them into armies once again."
 DKJ_talk_to_the_gammorean_tribes:0 "Talk To The Gammorean Tribes"
 DKJ_talk_to_the_gammorean_tribes_desc:0 "Gammoreans are a matriarchal race of very strong, very stupid humanoids. Although their intelligence and language skills are limited, they make excellent guards and warriors, and as they have no starships of their own the Hutts own a monopoly on employing them."
 DKJ_ktg_recruitment_drive:0 "KTG Recruitment Drive"
 DKJ_ktg_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "Klatooinians are another servant species of ours, one which has served for over 25,000 years and reveres Hutts as God-like figures. The Klatooinian Trade Guild is officially an organisation to help the natives find work offworld, though in reality it is a front to sell Klatooinians into indentured servitude or even slavery."
