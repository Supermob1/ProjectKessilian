 #HEARTS OF DURASTEEL REPUBLIC FOCUSES
 REP_the_war_economy:0 "The War Economy"
 REP_the_war_economy_desc:0 "With the Clone Wars upon us, the Republic must rapidly transition to a proper war economy. Thankfully, the legal precedent for transitioning to war economics has been recognized by the Senate. Together, victory will be achieved."
 REP_managing_the_manufacturing_sector:0 "Managing the Manufacturing Sector"
 REP_managing_the_manufacturing_sector_desc:0 "Despite the loss of several industrial centers to the Separatists, the Republic maintains a strong and massive manufacturing capability. However, it will need to be carefully managed to ensure the war is won."
 REP_blastech_contracts:0 "BlasTech Contracts"
 REP_blastech_contracts_desc:0 "BlasTech is one of the largest and most advanced arms manufacturers in the galaxy, and they have remained firmly in support of the Republic. In order to maintain not only their loyalty, but their discount and experimental designs, the Senate has agreed to sign constracts granting them a near monopoly in supplying arms to the GRA."
 REP_expanding_tech_factories_on_byblos:0 "Expanding Tech Factories on Byblos"
 REP_expanding_tech_factories_on_byblos_desc:0 "While home to criminals, Byblos is also home to BlasTech. As part of our investment in the company, the Chancellor has authorized funds be routed to Byblos' infrastucture and expansion of its factories. These will, of course, be BlasTech factories, benefitting the company and helping to provide work to the populace."
 REP_make_it_better:0 "Make It Better"
 REP_make_it_better_desc:0 "The Senate has agreed to a war economy, but the Chancellor, with his emergency powers, has the ability to help define what our industrial and economic ministers prioritize. The Chancellor has informed them to emphasize the quality of military supplies, cutting down on errors and improving functionality. Of course, this at the cost of speed."
 REP_make_it_faster:0 "Make It Faster"
 REP_make_it_faster_desc:0 "The Senate has agreed to a war economy, but the Chancellor, with his emergency powers, has the ability to help define what our industrial and economic ministers prioritize. The Chancellor has informed them to emphasize the speed of military supply production, hastening our ability to arm our troops and repair equipment. Of course, this at the cost of more errors and malfunctions."
 REP_expanding_the_refineries_on_bespin:0 "Expanding the Refineries on Bespin"
 REP_expanding_the_refineries_on_bespin_desc:0 "Bespin, and several worlds like it, are a primary source of blaster-gas, which is refined into the plasma-based ammunition for blasters. By expanding our refineries, we can produce more munitions."
 REP_the_might_of_balmora:0 "The Might of Balmorra"
 REP_the_might_of_balmora_desc:0 "For centuries Balmorra has stood as a bastion of the Republic's military productions. Despite private contracts, Balmorra has not lost that position. Its manufactories and industrial might is now being reawakened again, called into service. Granted designs for Clone Trooper armor and equipment, the might of Balmorra will be thrown at the Separatist menace!"
 REP_the_giant_awoken:0 "The Giant Awoken"
 REP_the_giant_awoken_desc:0 "Now that we have carefully arranged our manufacturing sector towards industries benefitting our military, a ripple effect has begun. New jobs and opportunities in these sectors have now driven their autonomous expansion, just as the Chancellor predicted. The full weight of the Republic Economy is now, directly or indirectly, fueling the war effort! Praise the Chancellor, and pass the ammunition!"
 REP_rothana_heavy_engineering_contracts:0 "Rothana Heavy Engineering Contracts"
 REP_rothana_heavy_engineering_contracts_desc:0 "Rothana Heavy Engineering is a subsidiary of Kuat Drive Yards, anda company that specializes in durable, powerful equipment, and has handed the development of several projects for the Kaminoans when they were first creating the Clone Army. It is only logical to contract them as the GRA's supplier of vehicles and heavy equipment."
 REP_streamlined_production_pipeline:0 "Streamlined Production Pipeline"
 REP_streamlined_production_pipeline_desc:0 "The military production pipeline, that is the development of new equipment and weapons in the stages of conceptualizing, designing, prototyping, and post-production updates, is choked by red tape under Republic law. The Chancellor has seen fit to remove this, allowing our best minds to be free of wait-times, multiple approval  signatures, and war crimes committees."
 REP_desperate_times:0 "Desperate Times"
 REP_desperate_times_desc:0 "The Republic has been a place of a free but well-regulated market. The indiviudal has been protected while a consumerist society has been encouraged. But we do not live in normal times. The economic culture of the Republic must adapt to the demands of war."
 REP_droid_reclamation_on_gyndine:0 "Droid Reclamation on Gyndine"
 REP_droid_reclamation_on_gyndine_desc:0 "The Separatists use droids en masse, and while we do not have a droid army, we have use for our own droids and the materials used to build them. To that end, the Chancellor has authorized the establishment of a Droid Reclamation Plant on the administrative planet of Gyndine. Private consumers may not like 'recycled' products, but they'll have to learn to embrace it."
 REP_nationalize_key_industries:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
 REP_nationalize_key_industries_desc:0 "The free market and private industry have supported the Republic for many centuries. But times are changing, and this a war unlike any the Republic has faced in a millennia. To ensure the security of critical industries, nationalization programs have been approved. The economists will gripe, but the Chancellor has assured them this is only temporary."
 REP_extreme_rationing:0 "Extreme Rationing"
 REP_extreme_rationing_desc:0 "The Emergency Rationing Act will allow military command to designate sector wide rationing of a variety goods, even food. This will help relief efforts and, of course, the army and navy. This will not be popular, but the temporary and rotating nature of rations will help alleviate discontent. Over time, our citizens will learn how to live in occassional scarcity. Perhaps they'll come to enjoy polystarch bread and veg-meat!"
 REP_droid_assisted_manufacturing:0 "Droid-Assisted Manufacturing"
 REP_droid_assisted_manufacturing_desc:0 "While the Republic has been careful to avoid fully automating assemblylines for the sake of jobs and to keep droids to domestic and military usage, we cannot afford to be so charitable. Droids can work all hours of the day, without pay, and so we will authorize the use of droids to supplement an existing workforce. Some menial jobs may be lost forever, but the war economy will open up new opportunities."
 REP_improved_restraining_bolts:0 "Improved Restraining Bolts"
 REP_improved_restraining_bolts_desc:0 "Droids our politicians, raise our children, tend our sick. Were the enemy to hack any droids, the Republic could be endangered. To that end, stricter restraining bolts will be developed, keeping droids obedient and less capable of independent thought. While some may complain this will negatively impact a droid's performance, but this should be a praised move overall."
 REP_total_war:0 "Total War"
 REP_total_war_desc:0 "The concept of total war economic mobilization is not new, but not one the general public or the Senate will like. However, it may be needed. The Chancellor has authorized a secret protocol to begin guiding the private sector and nationalized industries towards total war economics to make its officializing a formality."
 REP_desperate_measures:0 "Desperate Measures"
 REP_desperate_measures_desc:0 "We live in extraordinary times, and we have begun shifting the economy to adjust. Adjustment to scarcity and recycling, and patriotic support for nationalization are begin to take affect. The economy is ready for war, and soon our citizens will be too."
 REP_control_the_banks:0 "Control the Banks"
 REP_control_the_banks_desc:0 "The loyalty of the Banking Clans are divided and dubious. It is only logical to begin getting the banks under government control. THe clans will complain, but their wealth will not be impacted. The economy, however, will be safer under direct government regulation."
 REP_longer_hours:0 "Longer Hours"
 REP_longer_hours_desc:0 "The Republic's labor laws are centuries old, and not suited to war time. While automation is more polific, we need citizens giving their all to the war effort. Employees will now be allowed to 'volunteer' to work longer hours for patriotic employers."
 REP_lower_pay:0 "Lower Pay"
 REP_lower_pay_desc:0 "Everyone deserves a living wage, but we currently are in a life or death situation. With greater scarcity and war economics, people need less as it is, and as such we will lower the minimum wage, allowing more money saved from government jobs, and more investment from private employers."
 REP_contacts_in_kuat:0 "Contacts in Kuat"
 REP_contacts_in_kuat_desc:0 "Kuat Drive Yards has been making top-of-the-line ships for a long time. The Republic has not had need for their services en masse before, but they have supplied planetary militias before, and they have remained loyal to the Republic. We will reach out to them and gain beneficial deals on war-ship production."
 REP_expanding_the_shipyards_on_kuat:0 "Expanding the Shipyards on Kuat"
 REP_expanding_the_shipyards_on_kuat_desc:0 "Nothing is done for free. If we expect Kuat Drive Yards to supply ships for the Republic, it is only fair we invest in them. To that end, the best idea is to fund expansion of their shipping yards. After all, this ultimately aids the Republic as much it does the company."
 REP_all_must_give:0 "All Must Give"
 REP_all_must_give_desc:0 "While the Republic has a large economy, tax revenue is not as high as it could be. By cutting tax breaks, non-essential welfare programs, and a general war tax on goods, we can help fund the war effort with ease! People may complain, but we all have to do our part, voluntarily or not."
 REP_a_guiding_hand:0 "Guiding Hand"
 REP_a_guiding_hand_desc:0 "Regulations have been a long-time cornerstone of Republic economics, caring for the individual and ensuring safety. In times of warfare and deception, it is natural the Republic would provide guidance to smaller corporations to stay productive and benefitting to the war effort. Government inspectors will be authorized to investigate company practices to keep them in-line with new regulations."
 REP_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
 REP_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "With traitors everywhere, trust is hard to find. The Chancellor has authorized the funding of zealous loyalists like the Commission for the Protection of the Republic (COMPOR) to help boost loyalty in the populace. This now includes ensuring loyalty within unions and corporations that members are a part of."
 REP_wartime_relief_efforts:0 "Wartime Relief Efforts"
 REP_wartime_relief_efforts_desc:0 "We are funding the war effort well, and still have a steady budget. The Chancellor has proposed a small tax bump and the slashing of smaller government programs to fund relief efforts, giving subsidy to those impacted personally by the war. It may be pricey, but it will be a very popular program. And public support is crucial a civil war, after all."
 REP_total_control:0 "Total Control"
 REP_total_control_desc:0 "The recent reforms we have passed have given the Chancellor, and thus the Republic, firm control over its civilian economy. The banks and markets are safe, people are working more for less, and Separatist influence in the civilian sector is shrinking. As an added bonus, this has demonstrated to the public that total control means stability and safety!"
 REP_death_of_padme_amidala:0 "The Death of Padmé Amidala"
 REP_death_of_padme_amidala_desc:0 "A great tragedy has befallen the Republic. Senator Padmé Amidala Naberrie, former Queen of Naboo, champion of compromise and justice, has died. Killed with kouhun by a yet uncaptured assassin, eyes turn to her enemies amongst the Separatists. Calls for blood ring even from moderates, appalled see such a young and pure light in politics snuffed out by traitors."
 REP_the_republic_at_war:0 "The Republic At War"
 REP_the_republic_at_war_desc:0 "With the Separatists not only clearly behind Amidala's murder, but a threat to the Republic at large, the discovery of Sifo Diyas' Clone Army has triggered a passage of not only the Military Creation Act, but a declaration of war against the Separatists."
 REP_first_response_clones:0 "First Response Clones"
 REP_first_response_clones_desc:0 "The Clone Army was clearly an act of wise foresight by a Jedi Master, but they remain untested and will face harsh odds. It has been decided, thanks to the passage of the MCA, that the Clones will be used as a First Response force, hitting hard and fast, our new military coming in after them. Once we finish raising it, of course."
 REP_authorize_the_treason_act:0 "Authorize the Treason Act"
 REP_authorize_the_treason_act_desc:0 "The Anti-Sedition and Counterterrorism Act, also known as the Treason Act, is a controversial piece of legislation to allow sweeping surveillance and empowerment of local law enforcement, aimed at strangling Separatist terror cells in their craddle. While harsh, it is for the greater good, not unlike Amidala's vote of No Confidence in Valorum. We must strive to emulate her courage."
 REP_amidala_the_martyr:0 "Amidala the Martyr"
 REP_amidala_the_martyr_desc:0 "Already, Padmé Amidala has become a symbol of the Republic and Anti-Separatism. We ought to encourage this. Not only are the Separatists a gang of corrupt corporatists and opportunists — the kind of scum Amidala fought against — but she always stood for unity. We will use her image for recruitment and propaganda, making her the Face of the Republic. It's what she would have wanted."
 REP_soldiers_of_the_core:0 "Soldiers of the Core"
 REP_soldiers_of_the_core_desc:0 "The blatant murder of a beloved Senator has galvanized the public. While many consider the Republic pacifist after centuries, now the public at large wishes for a fight. Recruitment is strong, and now even the Core, the most aristocrat and content region in the Galaxy, has been struck by patriotic fervor."
 REP_new_jedi_lords:0 "New Jedi Lords"
 REP_new_jedi_lords_desc:0 "Once, the Jedi fought wars in the Outer Rim, establishing themselves as benevolent rulers until Republic control was reestablished. This strategy will be useful to aid administering occupation zones. Jedi Generals will be assigned worlds to administer and hold with their own personal Clone Legions. The public may begin to see the Jedi as warlords with personal fiefdoms, but that's a small price for security."
 REP_the_geonosis_campaign:0 "The Geonosis Campaign"
 REP_the_geonosis_campaign_desc:0 "Geonosis has served as the de facto capital of the Separatists ever since our declaration of war. We must make it a primary target. Taking it will demoralize the Separatists and empower our troops. A new army will be organized near Geonosis, in hopes of driving straight for the putrid heart of the Confederates."
 REP_peace_was_never_an_option:0 "Peace Was Never an Option"
 REP_peace_was_never_an_option_desc:0 "As the war continues, we have come to a realization: we can never live in peace while the Separatists survive. Negotiating peace will set a dangerous precedent, and allow traitors to reinfiltrate us. As of now, we know our enemies. They have outed themselves, and stand in our cross-hairs. We must not let them slip back into the shadows! We must march to eradicate all Separatist traitors!"
 REP_soften_them_up:0 "Soften Them Up"
 REP_soften_them_up_desc:0 "The Jedi, with their clone armies, have stood at the front line. Now we must begin our onslaught by having them begin a true war to end all wars. The Senate has authorized attacks on Separatist non-military targets; no mercy will be shown, and the Jedi will press attacks relentlessly against Separatist strongholds, weakening their grip until our main army drives them out."
 REP_better_dead_than_confed:0 "Better Dead, Than Confed"
 REP_better_dead_than_confed_desc:0 "The Chancellor has given the word; all military and government personnel of the Separatist government are to be executed, either after trial or on the battlefield. The Jedi may complain, but this is a matter of Republic law. If a former citizen, for that status is also now revoked, would stand with traitors, then they can be buried with them too."
 REP_the_new_system:0 "The New System"
 REP_the_new_system_desc:0 "As the war has continued, many regions of the Confederacy have begun to grow accustomed to our military rule. Furthermore the Senate is hesitant to immediately reintegrate these regions back into the Republic in full. A new system has been proposed, focusing on a Jedi-led 'Reconstruction' of the Confederate systems. After some time reforming, these regions be will readmitted into the Republic."
 REP_jedi_commissariats:0 "Jedi Commissariats"
 REP_jedi_commissariats_desc:0 "The Jedi are to spearhead societal 'Reconstruction' efforts, removing Separatist influence in CIS systems, and are already acting as lords of conquered territories. To that end, we shall formalize the military rule of certain systems into official Jedi Commissariats, easing back the Senate's control of the areas. This sits uneasy with the public, but the Order seems to welcome less bureaucratic meddling in their affairs."
 REP_legitimize_unitism:0 "Legitimize Unitism"
 REP_legitimize_unitism_desc:0 "Unitism is a new ideology. It calls for strong, stable leadership to rally behind in troubling times. Effectively, they endorse Chancellor Palpatine's actions, and believe they should be the norm in perilous times. Palpatine has not officially endorsed their thinking. In finally doing so, the patriots of the Republic will quickly flock to the Unitist banner."
 REP_forward_unto_victory:0 "Foward Unto Victory!"
 REP_forward_unto_victory_desc:0 "Now that we have decided how to handle newly conquered territory, it is time to ramp up the war. As we enter this second phase, we have clear vision and objectives. Forward, soldiers! Unto our moment of Victory! For the Chancellor! For the Republic!"
 REP_the_unthinkable:0 "The Unthinkable"
 REP_the_unthinkable_desc:0 "The Chancellor is dead! The beloved Chancellor Palpatine has suffered a sudden heart attack. His passing has sent the Republic reeling..."
 REP_close_the_banks:0 "Close the Banks"
 REP_close_the_banks_desc:0 "We cannot allow the economy to continue to be devastated by the panic Palpatine's death has caused. We must authorize the freezing of the stock exchange and banks until things have calmed down."
 REP_a_national_tragedy:0 "A National Tragedy"
 REP_a_national_tragedy_desc:0 "Palpatine's death has impacted more than just government. The Senate, the military, the public, everyone has been affected. We must issue a statement recognizing the impact of this tragic event, to present solidarity with the public. And we shall tell everyone, friend and foe, that we shall endure."
 REP_maintain_the_war_effort:0 "Maintain the War Effort"
 REP_maintain_the_war_effort_desc:0 "While these are dark times, we cannot let shock and sorrow compromise the war effort. Both amongst the troops and amongst the workers, we must encourage enduring committment to winning the war."
 REP_period_of_mourning: "Declare a Period of Mourning"
 REP_period_of_mourning_desc:0 "To further rally public support and help the Republic heal, an official period of mourning will be declared, though the length is still debated. We shall allow shrines of memorial, and government buildings will fly the Republic's black variant flag."
 REP_present_strength:0 "Present Strength"
 REP_present_strength_desc:0 "Acting Chancellor Amedda and the Security Council have agreed that the Separatists cannot be allowed to use the loss of Palpatine to their advantage. We must present strength to the enemy, and as such military action will be increased, with renewed offenses on all fronts."
 REP_temporary_jedi_command:0 "Temporary Jedi Command"
 REP_temporary_jedi_command_desc:0 "Many systems are in disarray following Palpatine's death. Order must be restored where rioting, panic, and Separatist revolt are now common. The Jedi are being granted autonomy to take their legions where needed to fulfill this task."
 REP_investigate_hidden_files:0 "Investigate Hidden Files..."
 REP_investigate_hidden_files_desc:0 "A staffmember has stumbled upon strange files in Palpatine's personal effects. The Acting Chancellor must decide if they are to be left alone for him (or his replacement) to examine at a later date, or simply destroyed, respecting Palpatine's privacy."
 REP_emergency_election:0 "The Emergency Election"
 REP_emergency_election_desc:0 "A semblance of order and calm has been gained. However, for normalcy to return, a proper, legitimate Chancellor must be elected from amongst the Senate. Numerous people are trying to take advantage of the power vaccuum..."
 REP_chancellor_organa:0 "Chancellor Organa"
 REP_chancellor_organa_desc:0 "While a close vote, Bail Organa of Alderaan has been elected Supreme Chancellor. While friendly to Inclusivists, his Core origins mean that the aristocratic, centrist ideals of Corism will likely be prevelant in his administration."
 REP_tragic_but_righteous:0 "Tragic, But Righteous Duty"
 REP_tragic_but_righteous_desc:0 "The war is a tragic one, on that Chancellor Organa agrees with his Inclusivist friends. But it is a necessity to ensure the Republic is stable. It must be won, both to keep the Republic strong, and to save those suffering under the Separatists."
 REP_the_new_republic:0 "The New Republic"
 REP_the_new_republic_desc:0 "The Republic has obviously had failings. But rather than abandon it, Chancellor Organa desires a rebirth. A new advisory committee is drafting new constitutional amendments to ensure greater personal liberty and regional autonomy, while also granting the Core Worlds a position as a moderating influence."
 REP_a_discreet_purge:0 "A Discreet Purge"
 REP_a_discreet_purge_desc:0 "Organa does not believe in political violence or monopolization of power. However, the Unitist personality cult of Palpatine is a threat to democracy itself, especially its more radical members. The ringleaders will be reassigned, threatened with scandal, or convinced to retire."
 REP_accept_limitations:0 "Accept Limitations"
 REP_accept_limitations_desc:0 "The Chancellor's emergency powers are a necessity, as has been seen. But Organa agrees some go too far. Thus, he will accept a number of limitations and repeals of emergency powers. No power should unlimited."
 REP_playing_the_game:0 "Playing the Game"
 REP_playing_the_game_desc:0 "The cruelty of politics isn't something that can be snapped away. The game must be played, with information as the deadliest weapon. The only means to curtail corruption is to hold the corrupt in your crosshairs until they comply."
 REP_reach_out_to_the_rim:0 "Reach Out to the Rim"
 REP_reach_out_to_the_rim_desc:0 "While a Corist, believing in the need for the Founding Systems' loyalist influence, Organa is not heartless. The Outer Rim deserves the same prosperity and liberty as the Core. By granting territorial sectors Senators and investigating administrative corruption, Organa hopes to integrate the Rim as a true part of the Republic."
 REP_civility_and_stability:0 "Civility and Stability"
 REP_civility_and_stability_desc:0 "Chancellor Organa is far from done bringing about his New Republic, but the groundwork has been laid out.

 REP_chancellor_amidala:0 "Chancellor Amidala"
 REP_chancellor_amidala_desc:0 "Rallying the idealists of the Republic behind her, Padmé Amidala Naberrie of Naboo has been elected Supreme Chancellor. A true Inclusivist, her administration is one that will strive to benefit everyone, and turn the Republican Dream into reality."
 REP_the_peace_committee:0 "The Peace Committee"
 REP_the_peace_committee_desc:0 "War is a blight. This Chancellor Amidala believes strongly.

 REP_a_better_republic:0 "A Better Republic"
 REP_a_better_republic_desc:0 "In Chancellor Amidala's view, the Republic already has the groundwork for a near-perfect system. Corruption, misunderstanding, and factionalism have hindered the Republican Dream. Amidala will fight to ensure these obstacles are removed."
 REP_reject_emergency_powers:0 "Reject Emergency Powers"
 REP_reject_emergency_powers_desc:0 "While they may be useful, Chancellor Amidala has decided to refuse all emergency powers. If the Republic's system cannot function and endure in hard times, then they cannot be relief upon in good times. Never shall the Republic have a monarch."
 REP_crusade_against_corruption:0 "Crusade Against Corruption"
 REP_crusade_against_corruption_desc:0 "Chancellor Amidala has seen first hand the death and destruction corruption and greed can bring. A crusade will be launched to end bribery and backroom deals, with harsh penalties for all forms of corruption. Such scum cannot be allowed to flourish."
 REP_political_savant:0 "Political Savant"
 REP_political_savant_desc:0 "While Chancellor Amidala may have rejected emergency powers, she does not need them. A political prodigy from a young age, she is a cunning women who has the wit and will to leverage the Republic's political machines. Exposing the scandals of her opponents, protecting her allies, and navigating the bureaucracy of the Republic, Amidala will ensure that what needs be done, will."
 REP_zero_tolerance_for_intolerance:0 "Zero Tolerance for Intolerance"
 REP_zero_tolerance_for_intolerance_desc:0 "A disgusting precedent of Core-favoritism and Humanocentrism grew under Palpatine, an unfortunate side effect of needing support for the war. Chancellor Amidala, however, will not allow this to continue. Discriminatory practices, institutionalized speciesism, exploitation, and regional neglect will be stamped out by any means necessary."
 REP_reform_and_repair:0 "Reform and Repair"
 REP_reform_and_repair_desc:0 "Chancellor Amidala is not yet finished in perfecting the Republic. But she has gotten started, has set in motion an unstoppable wave that will wash away corruption and division. The Republic will be reformed and repaired. No longer will the Republic be built on empty promises."
 REP_chancellor_amedda:0 "Chancellor Amedda"
 REP_chancellor_amedda_desc:0 "Despite facing numerous contenders, Mas Amedda has secured his place as Supreme Chancellor in what was certainly a free and fair election. A close ally of Palpatine, Amedda will likely not emulate his moderate predecessor as much as institute the Unitist ideals of Palpatine's personality cult."
 REP_reaching_out_to_old_friends:0 "Reach Out to Old Friends"
 REP_reaching_out_to_old_friends_desc:0 "Chancellor Amedda was once an ally and friend of the Trade Federation. Old friends now have prominence in the CIS and amongst the late Sidious' favor, and these ties could be leveraged to secure Amedda some desperately needed victories for the Republic. For the right price, of course."
 REP_voice_of_the_emperor:0 "Voice of the Emperor"
 REP_voice_of_the_emperor_desc:0 "Mas Amedda is known for three things: his loyalty to Palpatine, his obsession with procedure, and his booming voice. Few will be able to interrupt him, he will throw every by-law and rule on record at his opponents. As his words shout them down, red tape will choke them out."
 REP_false_war:0 "False War"
 REP_false_war_desc:0 "Chancellor Amedda has contacted his fellow servants of Sidious amongst the Separatists. With their master gone, a new opportunity arises; to keep the war endless and ongoing, lining pockets with wealth and furthering political power. Every so often, a battle lost, fear risen, then hope gained with a thrilling assault. All according to plan."
 REP_man_behind_the_curtain:0 "The Man Behind Curtain"
 REP_man_behind_the_curtain_desc:0 "Mas Amedda may be Chancellor, but he is nothing without Sate Pestage, Palpatine's oldest aide and confidant. The conniving emmisary is key to keeping Amedda's plans on track, pulling all the strings needed. But at what point does the puppeteer's patron become but another puppet?"
 REP_fostering_palpatines_legacy:0 "Fostering Palpatine's Legacy"
 REP_fostering_palpatines_legacy_desc:0 "Key to Chancellor Amedda's ambitions of personal power is keeping the veneration of Palpatine alive. Monuments will be erected, portraits hung and quotations engraved, his name memoralized on hospitals and offices. No one will forget the Great Sheev Palpatine. And no one will forget that Amedda and his cohort at the torchbearers of his legacy, with an empire built in his memory."
 REP_working_in_the_shadows:0 "Working in the Shadows"
 REP_working_in_the_shadows_desc:0 "Pestage has handled the Senate and Amedda has taken care of the public. The military, however, remains difficult to control. The solution? Armand Isard. Another of Sidious' circle, and a genius spymaster. As the third of the new triumvirate, he will keep the military in line with his network of operatives and pseudo-commissars."
 REP_fear_and_guile:0 "Fear and Guile"
 REP_fear_and_guile_desc:0 "There is still much work to be done. However, the Secret Empire is already forming, fueled by a masterfully planned war. Fear will keep the people obedient, and guile will leverage the elite to Amedda, Pestage, and Isard's will. A toast to the Republic! And to the Empire growing under its skin!"
 REP_emergency_government:0 "The Emergency Government"
 REP_emergency_government_desc:0 "No one has gained a majority vote in the Senate. The failed candidates' support bases have fractured, but the Republic needs firm leadership. The Admiralty has decided to act; a military committee will command of the executive branch, until a new Chancellor is agreed on. No one man shall rule, and the measures are temporary. But there is a war to win."
 REP_dauntless_to_domination:0 "Dauntless to Domination"
 REP_dauntless_to_domination_desc:0 "Now that the Executive Committee has been created, the war must be prioritized over politics. New ships are part of that, along with the dismissal of all regulations needed for fleets to enter any part of Republic space. Our ships shall go where they please, and are needed."
 REP_a_stronger_order:0 "A Stronger Order"
 REP_a_stronger_order_desc:0 "The Executive Committee is meant to be temporary, but its membership is in agreement that this is a chance to improve the weakened Republic. Militarism must be strengthened, alongside strong devotion to the rule of law. A new, stronger order will be forged in the time we have."
 REP_managing_the_populace:0 "Managing the Populace"
 REP_managing_the_populace_desc: "There has been surprising backlash to the creation of the Executive Committee. We must work to improve its popularity, playing to militarist and Unitist sentiments. There is also a proposal to leak false stories and stage a few victimless events to improve public opinion. These plans will be approved."
 REP_placate_rivalries:0 "Placate Rivalries"
 REP_placate_rivalries_desc:0 "The Executive Committee was established to overcome political infighting. However, factions have formed; old guard traditionalists under Admiral Yularen, and Unitist radicals rally behind the newly promoted Admiral Tarkin. Neither has the upperhand, but the two sides have come to a temporary understanding, at least while the Committee is cementing its grasp."
 REP_foment_fanatacism:0 "Foment Fanaticism"
 REP_foment_fanatacism_desc:0 "The only way to prevent the growth of Separatists and other traitors in the present and future is to ensure the fanatic loyalty of the average citizen matches a soldiers. New propaganda and education reforms will help cure the public of disloyalty. Soon, traitors will have nowhere to hide."
 REP_one_state_one_galaxy:0 "One State, One Galaxy"
