CIS_his_loyal_right_hand_desc:0 "Asajj Ventress has already been training in the ways of the Sith for years. With Sidious no longer in command, there is no need for any further subterfuge about Tyranus's intentions for her. It is time to make her a Sith Lord in name as well as in fact."
CIS_the_prodigal_daughter:0 "The Prodigal Daughter"
CIS_the_prodigal_daughter_desc:0 "Ventress has fled, swearing vengeance on Tyranus and anyone who aids him. But there is no sense in dwelling now on the training that went to waste, or scenarios that might have been--it is time to consider alternative options."
CIS_continue_her_training:0 "Continue Her Training"

CIS_confirm_her_allegiance_desc:0 "Despite the promise she shows, Ventress has displayed signs of disloyalty in the past--not just to Dooku, but to the Dark Side itself. Obviously, this is unacceptable; she must be brought in line before her apprenticeship can go forward."
CIS_seek_a_new_apprentice:0 "Seek a New Apprentice"
CIS_seek_a_new_apprentice:0 "Fortunately, Ventress is not the only person in the galaxy who is strong in the Dark Side. Several other plausible candidates for a new apprentice have presented themselves--but only one will rise to the vaunted title of "Darth"."

CIS_the_outsider:0 "The Outsider"
CIS_the_outsider_desc:0 "Savage Oppress was once Ventress's ally in her vendetta against Tyranus, but he can serve the dark side better as a new Sith apprentice. Forcing him to submit to Tyranus's will is bound to be no easy task, but it will be worthwhile nonetheless."
CIS_break_him_down: "Break Him Down"
CIS_break_him_down_desc:0 "To ensure that there is no chance of the light reasserting itself in Vos, all vestiges of his former identity must be destroyed by any means necessary. It will be a painful process, to say the least--but his suffering will only make him stronger."
CIS_encourage_his_bloodlust:0 "Encourage His Bloodlust"
CIS_encourage_his_bloodlust_desc:0 "Krell is a being who takes joy in slaughter, for whom the suffering and death of his foes is its own reward. Bringing this quality to the forefront of his psyche will strengthen his connection to the Dark Side."
CIS_twist_her_morals:0 "Twist Her Morals"
CIS_twist_her_morals_desc:0 "Unlike the other potential apprentices, Offee still clings to a misguided sense of "morality". But, while unfortunate, this weakness is not insurmountable. She must simply be...convinced...that the only way to accomplish her goals is to set those fetters aside."
CIS_alter_his_body:0 "Alter His Body"
CIS_alter_his_body_desc:0 "Oppress is a titanic being with immense strength and durability, but it is not in the nature of the Sith to be satisfied with any amount of power, no matter how great. With sorcery and cybernetics Oppress's form can be enhanced even further...while making him dependent on his Master."
CIS_build_him_anew:0 "Build Him Anew"
CIS_build_him_anew_desc:0 "Once his Jedi origins have been consigned to oblivion, Vos must be reeducated and indoctrinated into Sith philosophy. His fragile mind can be molded by the superior power of Tyranus, making him an utterly fanatical devotee of the Dark Side."
CIS_rise_darth_enigma:0 "Rise, Darth Enigma"
CIS_rise_darth_enigma_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Quinlan Vos is no more. In his place rises Darth Enigma, a being of pure hatred. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall annihilate their foes."
CIS_feed_his_malice:0 "Feed His Malice"
CIS_feed_his_malice_desc:0 "The unique combination of cunning, brute force, and utter lack of compassion or empathy that enabled Krell to trick the 501st and 212th into murdering many of their own men is impressive for one so new to the Dark Side. He must be taught to develop and rely on those skills."
CIS_rise_darth_lanius:0 "Rise, Darth Lanius"
CIS_rise_darth_lanius_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Pong Krell is no more. In his place rises Darth Lanius, a remorseless slayer of the weak. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall make the galaxy bleed."
CIS_nurture_her_rage:0 "Nurture Her Rage"
CIS_nurture_her_rage_desc:0 "Offee carries a deep, vicious fury at the Jedi and their allies, and desires revenge on them at any cost. These emotions should be encouraged and strengthened in order to push her further down the path of the Sith."
CIS_rise_darth_abyssal:0 "Rise, Darth Abyssal"
CIS_rise_darth_abyssal_desc:0 "The training is now complete. Barriss Offee is no more. In her place rises Darth Abyssal, determined to reshape the galaxy in her image. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall reign supreme."
CIS_corrupt_his_mind:0 "Corrupt His Mind"
CIS_corrupt_his_mind_desc:0 "Oppress's attachments to his ally Ventress and his brother Maul are a weakness--and worse still, a weakness that can be used against not just him, but Tyranus as well. If he is to be an effective apprentice, he must come to despise all those he once fought alongside."
CIS_rise_darth_irae:0 "Rise, Darth Irae"
CIS_rise_darth_irae_desc:0 "Savage Oppress is no more. In his place rises Darth Irae, a wrathful force of destruction. Under the Rule of Two, the Sith shall crush all opposition."
