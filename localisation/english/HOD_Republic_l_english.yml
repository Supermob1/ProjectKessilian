 rep_fakeout.5.t: "The Flight of Three Million Credits"
 rep_fakeout.5.d: "For a moment, Padmé felt like she had truly done something that mattered in this horrible crisis - through all the unrest, terrorist attacks and diplomatic breakdowns, this time she had done it. When she promised talks with the Separatists infront of the Galactic Senate, half the delegations laughed and the other half hoped the young Senator could back it all up. But now she was here, a lone diplomat on the most sleek and expensive yacht she could pull from Naboo... but even then, through all the initial success, she couldn't possibly know what to expect.\n\nPadmé stood there, just outside the hangar as the equally sleek ship of black and gold with Confederate markings carefully maneuvered inside the yacht, dropping it's landing gear and touching down, the hangar bay doors slowly sealing again. The tension was palpable - the first encounter between Republic and Confederate officials; practically a recognition of independence already. Padmé moved through the airlock and towards the center of the hangar, near the Separatist ship, glancing at the busy crew already refuelling their guests.\n\nA door on the side of the ship opened, a staircase lowering all the way to the ground followed by a dozen security droids in formation - a near-human man in the back catching the Senator's eye. As the droids stopped, he stepped out of the ship as well, followed by a female aide that scanned the hangar like a hawk. The man had walked all the way up to Padmé, hands behind his back coupled with a cold stare. Padmé broke the silence, extending her hand; "Welcome aboard, I'm Senator Amidala of Naboo." It felt like an hour passed when about three seconds did, the near-human man keeping his hands to himself; "Kerch Kushi." Padmé kept her hand extended for a second longer, though she'd soon drop it, moving both behind her back with an anxious smile; "Pleasure to finally meet you, shall I give you the tour?""
 rep_fakeout.5.a: "Somebody get HoloNet News on the line!"
 rep_fakeout.6.t: "A Cruise through the Heavens"
 rep_fakeout.6.d: "It was a wonderful sight from here, below the bridge. A conference room with an almost three-sixty degree view to space - like standing on the very edge of a starship's bridge - a submarine surrounded by ocean. It was on the second day that the luxury cruiser was in a slingshot maneuver on Alderaan's sun; if one looked through the darkened windows, the planet itself was a mere speck off in the corner compared to the burning giant they were flying by. Padmé turned back to the Separatist delegation, awaiting their opening after the hopeless first day - first impressions matter alot, but perhaps it could all still be salvaged?\n\nFor a moment she thought about the sheer insanity of her mission - silently forsaken by half her peers to political suicide and publicly opposed by the other, a one-woman Republic delegation meeting with Separatists on a Naboo Luxury Yacht in orbit of Alderaan and it's sun with openly Pro-Republic pilots, a security crew of unarmed Separatist droids and starship technicians from Tatooine... maybe the senate was right, the hardliners, her own - what could possibly save this, what DID the Republic have to bargain with - or what did it have to bargain for?\n\n"So... Senator Amidala. To what lengths is the Republic willing to go?" A trick question perhaps, but she had only one answer; "What does the Separatist movement expect from us?"\n\nKerch couldn't help but smile for a moment - having been offered victory on a golden platter. "I expect you agree, Senator of Naboo, the corrupt corporations and monopolies that control the Senate must be dislodged... a token gesture of goodwill compared to the injustices your governments enable." Padmé fell silent for a moment - would throwing the megacorporations out of the Galactic Senate even be possible? Of course, she knew the great irony that so many of their rivals backed the Separatists. "While as a single senator, representing a movement sympathetic to your people, I cannot guarantee their removal... I promise you we will begin dismantling their monopolies. My faction in the Senate is also drafting countless bills to fight inequality in the Rim and corporate worlds, I have full confidence that they'll pass and revert the deep-rooted issues.""
 rep_fakeout.6.a: "The Separatists' approval eased the tension in the room"
 rep_fakeout.7.t: "A Day Long Remembered"
 rep_fakeout.7.d: "As complicated as it was, Padmé kept finding things to debate on. Trivial they were indeed, with limited authority and the trouble itself of unofficially-officially negotiating with a Separatist movement you can't expect to do much. Padmé had secured at least the approval of the Separatist delegation on matters of equality and the usual talk of Corporate overreach, but she had one last card to play. On the last day she flagged down Kerch for one final proposal, watching Alderaan's sun shrink by the minute as her ship was entering Alderaanian orbit.\n\n"Senator Kushi, I'm sure you agree that while better than we both expected, a one-off mission won't secure peace. In line with our policy towards the Separatist Movement; I propose establishing official diplomatic channels - the Supreme Chancellor's office and Count Dooku, the Galactic Senate and Separatist Senate." The offer took Kerch Kushi by a bit of a surprise; "Senator, official channels would mean recognition - a dangerous if not impossible undertaking." Padmé already knew her answer, the good old Republic was loophole heaven and if you can sit down for an hour, you can write yourself around anything. "Well then - if channels between two independent entities sound bad, for now we can write it off as the Galactic Senate trying to communicate better with its trillions of protesting citizens - opposing that is political suicide. Perhaps in due time would making it official be possible."\n\nWhen the two walked out of the conference room and to the HoloNet crew for the send-off that was planned from the beginning, Padmé remembered how at first she thought this all would be forced on both sides - but when the cameras and holorecorders started rolling, both their hands willingly and eagerly met for a genuine handshake. HoloNet News broadcasted the video and image across the vast Galaxy, from the Galactic Senate to the lowliest of Outer Rim cantinas. Padmé stayed aboard long after the Separatist delegation left - switching from channel to channel on the screen in the conference room - and while the languages spoken on the broadcasts were different each time, they had one thing in common - the image of a Republic Senator and Separatist Leader shaking hands infront of the Galactic Roundel and Separatist Hexagon. Celebrations over one of the most inconclusive diplomatic meetings lasted for days, Padmé's Luxury Yacht greeted like a distinguished warship back on Naboo."

 rep_fakeout.29.d:0 ""Are you sure about this, Peneilia?" the cheeky Padawan asked, his lightsaber raised.\n\n"This is the best way to find out what you need to refine - what you need to learn. Give me your best." A second later, he activated his lightsaber and charged with a heavy swing and a grunt, Peneilia quickly activating her own lightsaber and effortlessly blocking the strike, kicking the Padawan out of the way and onto the ground with her right leg. She took a step to the side; "No form. You're using a sword, not an axe. Act like it." \n\nThe Padawan quickly stood up, pushing his hair out of his eyes, taking a position and soon a proper Shii-Cho form. Peneilia nodded approvingly, the duel re-starting with a strong opening. Peneilia blocked a few good swings, the Padawan purposefully pushing her around and swinging at all possible angles, but even then the form was unrefined and she would often simply dodge out of the way of a stronger swing.\n\nPeneilia braced herself for the next, the Padawan's lightsaber hitting her own with significant augmented force. Both stared at each other through their glowing, flickering blades before Peneilia hopped backwards, turning off her lightsaber and sending him flying across the room with a push. "That was better, but you're still slow. Very slow. You need to let the force gui.." He zoned out, looking across the room at her in anger. He stood up, ignited his sword and jumped through the air.\n\nShe barely had time to register him activating his lightsaber when she blocked the incoming attack, and then the next, and another one, and another one... He was practically jumping circles around her, having her spin from side to side with unconventional acrobatics and daring strikes. His anger finally subsided as he had her in another saber lock, Peneilia breathing heavily in distress, gaining control of herself. "I... like it" she smiled. "You... might be a fan of Form seven.""

 rep_fakeout.36.d:0 "Ronbarr raised his shield alongside the rest of the riot police formation as the endless assault of debris and trash came upon them. He breathed heavily, remembering the golden rules from the occasional training he had received before the Separatist crisis, but it was nothing like reality. A thin line of perhaps sixty women stood in the wide street against a mob of hundreds - blast, to him it could've been thousands. With every brick, bottle and can that hit his shield or gear, he'd grow further scared, the unarmed citizens taunting the line from up close seemed like predators waiting for the right moment to pounce.\n\nThrough the chaos, he took a closer look into the distant crowd - people waving burning flags of the Republic, some even that of the Separatists. It reinforced his belief, the one thing that gave him warmth in the cold night. Suddenly a group of speeders flew past the street, each dropping canisters that blew into a dozen trails of tear gas above the crowd. "Alright boys, lets go!" echoed from behind as the people of the crowd ahead fell to the ground or ran away, the formation enveloping those who had stayed behind and mercilessly pursuing marked targets.\n\nJust for a moment, Ronbarr hesitated. He looked to the sides - seeing the streets of Coruscant in flames, the horizon a flickering yellow, like a battlefield. He'd see a protest medic on his knees infront of an injured teen, a policeman with his shock baton raised and ready to strike. He'd turn to the other side and see the mangled corpse of another servant of the law, kicked and beaten to death by the crowd that cut him off. Just for a moment, Ronbarr hesitated, and looked upon the horror that had consumed the Galaxy."

 REP_but_we_are_threatened_once_more2: "But we are threatened once more"
 REP_but_we_are_threatened_once_more2_desc: "The peaceful aims of the moderates are born from noble intentions, but they are ultimately misguided. If these “Separatists” truly intended to negotiate in good faith, they would not be trying to damage the unity of the Republic in pursuit of petty political goals. Such radicalism must be dealt with firmly and uncompromisingly, not coddled as the peace party intends."
 REP_and_we_shall_not_stand_idle: "And we shall not stand idle"
 REP_and_we_shall_not_stand_idle_desc: "Our allies in the Senate are preparing a battery of new proposals to prepare our economy, law enforcement, and even public discourse for the coming crisis. While these measures may seem disruptive at first glance, they are simply a recognition of a principle that has held firm for a millennium: Every citizen must rally to defend our great Republic in her time of need."
 REP_the_weakness_of_ruusan: "The Weakness of Ruusan"
 REP_the_weakness_of_ruusan_desc: "For a thousand years has the Ruusan Reformation stood largely unchallenged, and truth be told it has served it's purpose well, the Republic has grown with no enemy to fight, but it was a mishandled process. We traded prosperity for utter hopelessness - one that we carefully hid and pushed back, thinking the monsters of the past would not resurface once more.\n\nRuusan grows old... The "party" that supports it is our laughing stock. We will tear it apart piece by piece if need be, for the Republic needs us now more than ever, and it's patriots cannot hope to defend it when picking up a blaster in it's name is illegal."
 REP_encourage_local_militarisation: "Encourage Local Militarization"
 REP_encourage_local_militarisation_desc: "Proving the falsehood of their claims to be a peaceful political movement, the Separatists have begun to arm themselves. Despite the lamentable state of our armed forces, we must mount a strong response to these brazen threats to our society. Empowering sector and system governments to militarize will enable them to counter the Confederate threat."
 REP_the_war_on_pacifism: "The War on Pacifism"
 REP_the_war_on_pacifism_desc: "It has become obvious to all that the divides in our Republic are deepening, and refusing to pick a side only fractures its foundations further. Though we were once willing to tolerate the pacifists’ reservations, their continued intransigence demonstrates a lack of loyalty to our founding ideals. Such unpatriotic—perhaps even treasonous—behavior can no longer be tolerated."
 REP_anti_separatist_propaganda: "Anti-Separatist Propaganda"
 REP_anti_separatist_propaganda_desc: "The battle for the soul of the Republic is as much a conflict of hearts and minds as of politics and law. A mass propaganda campaign will ensure that the galactic masses see the virtues of the Republic—as well as the moral bankruptcy at the heart of the Separatist movement."           
 REP_fight_confederate_terrorism: "Fight Confederate Terrorism"
 REP_fight_confederate_terrorism_desc: "Count Dooku and his supporters are dangerous demagogues whose inflammatory rhetoric incites violence and terrorism against the legitimate galactic government. With this in mind, the Judicial Forces will compile a list of Dooku’s most ardent advocates and monitor their actions carefully. With the help of this task force, we will be forewarned and forearmed when Dooku calls for the conflict to escalate."
 REP_embargoes_in_all_but_name: "Embargoes in all but Name"
 REP_embargoes_in_all_but_name_desc: "It is utter folly to waste the productive capacities of the Republic on those who would spit on its generosity. Worse still, trading with the Confederacy helps it build up the industrial and military capacity to attack us. We must cut them off from our trade networks before they weaken us any further."
 REP_mobilise_the_jedi: "Mobilize the Jedi"
 REP_mobilise_the_jedi_desc: "The Jedi Order has repeatedly professed its loyalty to the Republic—and now is the time to put those oaths to the test. Their religious convictions must not stand in the way of their duties to our nation; they may be called upon to investigate its enemies, protect its interests, and perhaps even wage war in its defense."
 REP_and_we_shall_give_up_no_ground: "And we shall give no ground"
 REP_and_we_shall_give_up_no_ground_desc: "The more sectors join the Separatists and the more their ideology spreads, the more difficult it will become to prevent this situation from spiraling out of control. We will launch a political campaign to proactively ensure the loyalties of our citizenry, creating Republican strongholds where there now exists internecine conflict."
 REP_in_the_wider_galaxy: "In the Wider Galaxy"
 REP_in_the_wider_galaxy_desc: "The Republic consists of 1,024 sectors, encompassing a vast number of systems, planets, and local governments. Aligning them all is nigh-impossible, so we will focus on the bigger picture: preventing the defection of strategic sectors, containing those that have already declared their allegiance to the Confederacy, and limiting the “domino effect” of defecting regions influencing their neighbors towards Separatism."
 REP_the_loyal_of_the_rim: "The Loyal of the Rim"
 REP_the_loyal_of_the_rim_desc: "Though the Mid and Outer Rim are hotbeds of Separatist sentiment, there are still some there who have not forgotten their responsibilities to the Republic. Fostering loyalist sentiment in the outlying regions will be of great help in our struggle, for each world we bring on board brings us one step closer to strangling the Confederacy in its cradle."
 REP_the_shield_against_corporations: "The Shield against Corporations"
 REP_the_shield_against_corporations_desc: "The Shield Against Corporations: The Naboo Crisis paints a clear picture of the danger of megacorporate influence. The values of the banks and merchant guilds are alien to those of our virtuous Republic, and they wield private droid armies with which to enforce them on upstanding citizens. No more will their power go unchecked: they will be brought in line or else exposed for the traitors they are."
 REP_or_at_home: "Or at Home"
 REP_or_at_home_desc: "The growth of the Separatist movement has unfortunately sparked riots even on key Republic worlds such as Corellia, Alderaan, and Coruscant. Quelling this unrest and restoring law and order is crucial to presenting a united front against Count Dooku."
 REP_never_another_naboo: "Never another Naboo" 
 REP_the_loyal_of_the_core: "The Loyal of the Core"
 REP_the_loyal_of_the_core_desc: "The Core Worlds have been the Republic’s staunchest supporters since time immemorial. With the riots dying down, there has never been a better time to shore up that support. With the Core standing together as one, we will have a strong and stable base from which to fight back against the insidious influence of Separatism."
 REP_the_brewing_race_war: "The Brewing Race War"
 REP_the_brewing_race_war_desc: " Across hundreds of planets, the Human and Alien clashes. Cities burn, alien planets secede and the Republic shrinks - but in our apparent loss we see victory - we needn't say anything for people to take up arms over nation or ideology anymore.\n\nThe bullseye is painted - our greatest victory begins with a great loss."
 REP_the_blue_scare: "The Blue Scare"
 REP_the_blue_scare_desc: "Open your eyes, people of the Republic, our enemies are in our midst!\n\nThe Republic is threatened and it shall no longer take high treason without punishment, look around yourselves and see how rotten our civilisation is - actively torn apart from the inside, from the Galactic Senate to individual housing units. Apprehend these vile terrorists, take a stand against them for yourself and family, your neighbours and Nation, for tomorrow it could all be washed away by the Blue wave."
 REP_and_we_shall_last_another_thousand: "And we shall last another Thousand"
 REP_and_we_shall_last_another_thousand_desc: "The Galactic Republic has lasted for twenty five thousand years. It has gone through hard times, horrible times. Not three thousand years back the people that sat in our seats asked this same question and thought of the future; I offer you a future!\n\nThe likes of Sith and Eternal Empires will humble our Republic no more! For hundreds of years we have fought bloody conflicts because we refused to strike first, or because we were too blind to see them coming. Our fleets stand ready outside occupied territory - Today, the Republic will make the first move, and it will be one that exposes the Separatists for what monstrous radicals they truly are.\n\nWe will prove to the Galaxy that our flag will always fly! May it ever stand for safety, security, justice, and peace!"

 REP_the_military_creation_act:0 "The Military Creation Act"
 REP_the_military_creation_act_desc:0 "The Military Creation Act, as Palpatine has labeled his newest possible proposal to his cabinet, is not a new idea. The creation of a central armed forces for the Republic has been a hotly debated topic ever since the Ruusan Reformation.\n\nIn the past, various iterations of such a bill have been soundly defeated in the Senate. But with the Separatist Crisis building, it is time to revist the subject. At the least, the debate could startle the Separatists into calming down..."
 REP_rework_the_bill:0 "Rework the Draft"
 REP_rework_the_bill_desc:0 "The rough draft of the MCA has been completed, but it is largely based on bills rejected by the Senate. It must be revised if it stands a chance of passing, and it would be foolhardy to not update its language to reflect the state of the evolving crises it is being aimed to solve. This will take time, but Vice Chancellor Amedda has dutifully offered his services."
 REP_oppose_the_mca:0 "Oppose the Act"
 REP_oppose_the_mca_desc:0 "Senators Bel Iblis and Mothma are right! The Military Creation Act is more than an affront to the Ruusan Constitution, it is an affront to the principles of the Republic! A central military represents greater central power, and will likely only incense the autonomy-minded base of the Separatist Movement. In the name of sanity and self-determination, the MCA must be opposed."
 REP_age_old_alliance:0 "Age Old Alliance"
 REP_age_old_alliance_desc:0 "The informal, Mid-Rim dominated "Inclusivist" faction of the Senate has long had an alliance with the more aristocratically-minded Core Senators, stretching back centuries. Despite their top-down view of social reform, many of these Corists are proudly progressive and opposed to authoritarian centralization. \n\nIn building a united Opposition to the MCA, the Inclusivists reach out to these likeminded Corists to whip their allies into a stronger voting block. "
 REP_reach_across_the_aisle:0 "Reach across the Aisle"
 REP_reach_across_the_aisle_desc:0 "Traditionally, those who champion the Ruusan Reformation as the pinnacle of good governance do not align with the Inclusivist faction. Often they are at odds with Inclusivist proposals for social programs and economic interventionism.\n\nBut the MCA is something both sides can agree is an atrocity. Against Ruusanist values and against Inclusivist ideals. A meeting should be held between faction leaders to form a united front."
 REP_the_counter_proposal:0 "The REPUBLIC Act"
 REP_the_counter_proposal_desc:0 "The new Opposition coalition cannot just shut down the MCA without offering some alternatives. A crisis is approaching, and proponents will villify us if we do not have a counter-proposal.\n\nTogether, we shall draft an omnibus bill known as the Regional Empowerment for the Protection of Unity, Belligerency Limitation, and Local Intelligence Cooperation Act, or simply the REPUBLIC Act."
 REP_support_the_mca:0 "Support the Act"
 REP_support_the_mca_desc:0 "Chancellor Palpatine is right! The Military Creation Act is a necessary reform in order to safeguard our founding principles and liberties from its enemies, and will help to keep the Separatist Movement in check. In the name of safety and stability, the MCA must be supported."
 REP_rally_the_idealogues:0 "Rally the Radicals"
 REP_rally_the_idealogues_desc:0 "Amongst the so-called "Inclusivist" faction of the Senate are radical progressives and anticorporate reformists. While their faction is generally opposed to Unitist ideals of centralization and patriotic utilitarianism, many of them are terrified and disgusted by the corporate and xenonationalist elements within the Separatist Movement.\n\nBy reminding them as well of the Naboo Crisis, and how a Republic military would mean greater ease of ensuring compliance to reforms, we can sway these radicals to supporting the MCA."
 REP_necessary_concessions:0 "Corist Concessions"
 REP_necessary_concessions_desc:0 "Many of the aristocratic Core Senators have sympathy for a central military. We can play into their fear of Outer-Rim rable, and remind them of the recent instability of the Mid-Rim to garner more support from their centralist members.\n\nHowever, we will need to offer concessions to bring their faction fully on-board. Perhaps a guarantee of Core-world leadership in military command as the heart of the Republic..."
 REP_alter_the_terms:0 "Alter the Terms"
 REP_alter_the_terms_desc:0 "We have managed to create a sizable coalition of proponents for the MCA. However, it may not be enough. Certainly, many of our allies may turncoat at the last minute, and several of their faction members are already in league with the Opposition. A committee must be formed to amend the MCA to better appeal to the coalition as whole.\n\nYes, this may water down and weaken the MCA, but better something than nothing."
 REP_the_vote:0 "The Vote"
 REP_the_vote_desc:0 "It's time. We've built our coalition. We've spent weeks in board rooms writing and revising legislation. Now the final debates must begin.\n\nThis will be a lengthy process. The whole of the Senate must gather, which will take time, and the debates will surely be riddled with filibustering, last minute objections, political extortion, and other forms of unsavory politicking. But eventually fate of the MCA will be decided one way or another."

 REP_killed_in_the_cradle_desc:0 "It's done. The Military Creation Act has failed. This is not the first time the concept of a unified military for the Republic has died in the Senate. But this time, at such a crucial juncture, the gesture signifies a loud message of pacifism, autonomism, and Constitutional textualism in the Republic. Any legislation offered in counter will need months to be ready for debate, but already the process has begun in the background."

 REP_one_army_one_republic_desc:0 "It's done. The Military Creation Act has succeeded. This is the first time that the concept of a unified military for the Republic has not died in the Senate. In doing so, at such a crucial juncture, the gesture signifies a loud message of jingoism, centralism, and Constitutional pragmatism in the Republic. Now shall begin the grueling process of organzing the military, planning its exact structure, fielding officer candidates, and allocating funding. It may take months, but entire committees are dedicating their full attention to get started."
