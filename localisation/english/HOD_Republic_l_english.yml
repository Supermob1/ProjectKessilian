 rep_fakeout.5.t: "The Flight of Three Million Credits"
 rep_fakeout.5.d: "For a moment, Padmé felt like she had truly done something that mattered in this horrible crisis - through all the unrest, terrorist attacks and diplomatic breakdowns, this time she had done it. When she promised talks with the Separatists infront of the Galactic Senate, half the delegations laughed and the other half hoped the young Senator could back it all up. But now she was here, a lone diplomat on the most sleek and expensive yacht she could pull from Naboo... but even then, through all the initial success, she couldn't possibly know what to expect.\n\nPadmé stood there, just outside the hangar as the equally sleek ship of black and gold with Confederate markings carefully maneuvered inside the yacht, dropping it's landing gear and touching down, the hangar bay doors slowly sealing again. The tension was palpable - the first encounter between Republic and Confederate officials; practically a recognition of independence already. Padmé moved through the airlock and towards the center of the hangar, near the Separatist ship, glancing at the busy crew already refuelling their guests.\n\nA door on the side of the ship opened, a staircase lowering all the way to the ground followed by a dozen security droids in formation - a near-human man in the back catching the Senator's eye. As the droids stopped, he stepped out of the ship as well, followed by a female aide that scanned the hangar like a hawk. The man had walked all the way up to Padmé, hands behind his back coupled with a cold stare. Padmé broke the silence, extending her hand; "Welcome aboard, I'm Senator Amidala of Naboo." It felt like an hour passed when about three seconds did, the near-human man keeping his hands to himself; "Kerch Kushi." Padmé kept her hand extended for a second longer, though she'd soon drop it, moving both behind her back with an anxious smile; "Pleasure to finally meet you, shall I give you the tour?""
 rep_fakeout.5.a: "Somebody get HoloNet News on the line!"
 rep_fakeout.6.t: "A Cruise through the Heavens"
 rep_fakeout.6.d: "It was a wonderful sight from here, below the bridge. A conference room with an almost three-sixty degree view to space - like standing on the very edge of a starship's bridge - a submarine surrounded by ocean. It was on the second day that the luxury cruiser was in a slingshot maneuver on Alderaan's sun; if one looked through the darkened windows, the planet itself was a mere speck off in the corner compared to the burning giant they were flying by. Padmé turned back to the Separatist delegation, awaiting their opening after the hopeless first day - first impressions matter alot, but perhaps it could all still be salvaged?\n\nFor a moment she thought about the sheer insanity of her mission - silently forsaken by half her peers to political suicide and publicly opposed by the other, a one-woman Republic delegation meeting with Separatists on a Naboo Luxury Yacht in orbit of Alderaan and it's sun with openly Pro-Republic pilots, a security crew of unarmed Separatist droids and starship technicians from Tatooine... maybe the senate was right, the hardliners, her own - what could possibly save this, what DID the Republic have to bargain with - or what did it have to bargain for?\n\n"So... Senator Amidala. To what lengths is the Republic willing to go?" A trick question perhaps, but she had only one answer; "What does the Separatist movement expect from us?"\n\nKerch couldn't help but smile for a moment - having been offered victory on a golden platter. "I expect you agree, Senator of Naboo, the corrupt corporations and monopolies that control the Senate must be dislodged... a token gesture of goodwill compared to the injustices your governments enable." Padmé fell silent for a moment - would throwing the megacorporations out of the Galactic Senate even be possible? Of course, she knew the great irony that so many of their rivals backed the Separatists. "While as a single senator, representing a movement sympathetic to your people, I cannot guarantee their removal... I promise you we will begin dismantling their monopolies. My faction in the Senate is also drafting countless bills to fight inequality in the Rim and corporate worlds, I have full confidence that they'll pass and revert the deep-rooted issues.""
 rep_fakeout.6.a: "The Separatists' approval eased the tension in the room"
 rep_fakeout.7.t: "A Day Long Remembered"
 rep_fakeout.7.d: "As complicated as it was, Padmé kept finding things to debate on. Trivial they were indeed, with limited authority and the trouble itself of unofficially-officially negotiating with a Separatist movement you can't expect to do much. Padmé had secured at least the approval of the Separatist delegation on matters of equality and the usual talk of Corporate overreach, but she had one last card to play. On the last day she flagged down Kerch for one final proposal, watching Alderaan's sun shrink by the minute as her ship was entering Alderaanian orbit.\n\n"Senator Kushi, I'm sure you agree that while better than we both expected, a one-off mission won't secure peace. In line with our policy towards the Separatist Movement; I propose establishing official diplomatic channels - the Supreme Chancellor's office and Count Dooku, the Galactic Senate and Separatist Senate." The offer took Kerch Kushi by a bit of a surprise; "Senator, official channels would mean recognition - a dangerous if not impossible undertaking." Padmé already knew her answer, the good old Republic was loophole heaven and if you can sit down for an hour, you can write yourself around anything. "Well then - if channels between two independent entities sound bad, for now we can write it off as the Galactic Senate trying to communicate better with its trillions of protesting citizens - opposing that is political suicide. Perhaps in due time would making it official be possible."\n\nWhen the two walked out of the conference room and to the HoloNet crew for the send-off that was planned from the beginning, Padmé remembered how at first she thought this all would be forced on both sides - but when the cameras and holorecorders started rolling, both their hands willingly and eagerly met for a genuine handshake. HoloNet News broadcasted the video and image across the vast Galaxy, from the Galactic Senate to the lowliest of Outer Rim cantinas. Padmé stayed aboard long after the Separatist delegation left - switching from channel to channel on the screen in the conference room - and while the languages spoken on the broadcasts were different each time, they had one thing in common - the image of a Republic Senator and Separatist Leader shaking hands infront of the Galactic Roundel and Separatist Hexagon. Celebrations over one of the most inconclusive diplomatic meetings lasted for days, Padmé's Luxury Yacht greeted like a distinguished warship back on Naboo."
