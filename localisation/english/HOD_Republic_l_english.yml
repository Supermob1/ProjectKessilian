 legacy_of_ruusan_desc:0 "The Ruusan Reformation has been widely criticised at its inception, having essentially abolished all of the Military, but no sane man can say it hasn't brought riches, material and cultural to the wide Galaxy. Would-be soldiers and mercenaries chose joyous, peaceful lives instead, weapons of all kinds became seen as barbaric and uncivilised tools and the Galactic Republic has known peace for two thousand years."
 republic_of_thousands:0 "A Republic of Thousands"
 republic_of_thousands_desc:0 "The Galactic Republic today is made up of a little over a million and three hundred thousand planets - thousands of species coexist in our territories. While this has brought us great prestige and loyal followers from the Galaxy's unfortunate, it has historically resulted in periods of instability - we have to accommodate essentially every sentient species in existence."

 widespread_race_war_desc:0 "The Separatist Crisis and rise of Megacorporations in our attempt to further colonise and build up the worlds of the Outer Rim resulted in waves of protests, counter protests and riots targeting the borderline Humano-centric and Core-centric policies of the present Republic."
