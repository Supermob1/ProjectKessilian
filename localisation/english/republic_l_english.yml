##Events
 republic.1.t:0 "The State of the Galaxy"
 republic.1.d:0 "The Republic is facing a crisis. Ever since the passage of tax and tariff reforms resulted in the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation, relations between the Republic and its economic moguls have continued to deteriorate. Adding to this issue is increasing corruption and bureaucratic incompetence within the Republic, triggering unrest in non-Core systems. These dissidents, both industrialists and democratic reformers, have now rallied under former Jedi Master Dooku, the Count of Serenno.\n\nWith a full blown Separatist Movement at our doorstep, the Republic is torn on how to act. Some call for a military response, breaking centuries of pacifism. And while many feel the Separatists have valid points, there is great concern for the precedent that placating them would set. Paralyzed by inaction, the Seperatists only grow stronger.\n\n Beyond this, the Jedi fear that a Sith Lord is pulling to strings behind recent conflicts, and the galaxy seems set on the path to conflict."
 republic.1.a:0 "The Republic will endure!"
 republic.2.t:0 "The Ritual"
 republic.2.d:0 "As the blade crossed his palm, Sidious let out little more than a slow exhale. He stared at the circle of runes and the pile of gore at its epicenter. And for a moment, he hesitated. \n\n This was old Sith sorcery. The kind that demanded a higher price than mere hatred. Its power would be immense, and its occurrence would be impossible to hide from the Jedi. But desperate time called for necessary measures. And while Sidious had plan upon plan, Dooku had become a dangerous liability. Correspondence had slowed, orders were followed with increasing inaccuracy, and his spies were being cut out of Dooku’s network. Sidious wondered if the old fool had grown a spine or a conscience. Was he no longer committed to the Sith, or was he at last planning to strike and take supremacy? \n\n Ultimately, it mattered little. What did matter was that Sidious no longer firmly controlled both sides of the conflict. He would soon have to fight a war. A real war, not a show where all danced to his instruction. The ritual was the answer to his quandry; to corrupt Skywalker’s soul, kill Dooku, and alter the course of the latest crucial battle would take time Sidious didn’t have. They had to happen now, and the Dark Side would aid him. \n\nLightning erupted from his fingertips, pouring energy into the blood offering. But as he chanted, channeling his hatred and wishes to call upon the Dark Side, something felt wrong. He did not feel the cold but welcome embrace of the darkness thanking him for his offering. He felt only... amusement, as if the Force sneered at him. He sent his demands again. ‘Corrupt the boy! Kill the fool! Win me my war!’ he snarled. But the darkness refused. He felt it then, cold claws digging into his heart. And he felt the anger, both chilling and burning as it weighed down upon him, forcing him to knees. Had he demanded too much, or offered too little? Or had the Dark Side merely grown tired of the Sith who thought himself its master?\n\n Sheev felt terror for the first time in decades."
 republic.2.a:0 "I submit! Forgive me!"
 republic.2.b:0 "No! No no no! Obey me!"
 republic.3.t:0 "Order 66"
 republic.3.d:0 ""The time has come. The Jedi would get in th way of our new order. One of peace and prosperity for the galaxy. Commanders, execute order 66"\n\nAcross the galaxy hundreds of clone commanders received the same order, not from the JEdi generals they've bleed and fought next to for years nor even from the usual friendly face of the supreme chancellor. Well the last one was a half truth. It was the chancellor even if it was no longer his title though his face was far from friendly but across the galaxy be it by chip or their own loyalty and devotion each clone trooper knew what was to be done. Countless Jedi were cut down. Slain and shot in the back by their very comrades and in perhaps an irony it went unnoticed by most. In mere hours one of the oldest institutions, protectors of the galaxy, were wiped out. Just gone, in a single instant with many never even realizing it until days later. In any case a message was clear, a new order was rising. One without the Jedi and soon the Republic."
 republic.3.a:0 "Good riddance"
 republic.4.t:0 "Duel on Mustafar"
 republic.4.d:0 ""Its over Anakin I have the high ground!"\n\n"You underestimate my power!"\n\n"Don't try it"\n\n These were the last words shared between former master and apprentice, between two friends. Obi-Wan had gone to Mustafar to put a stop to this. To all of this. Anakin was too far gone. He had demolished the order, razed the temple, and kill the separatist council and even assaulted his own wife with the force. Obi-Wan knew what he must do but he did not want it to come to this. Anakin was going to do something foolish and he saw it coming. Their fight on this hell of a planet was at its end and only one would be walking away in one piece. But did Anakin really have that power? Anakin leaps and both their blades ignite in the end..."
 republic.4.a:0 "Don't doubt the high ground."
 republic.4.b:0 "He under estimated his power."
 republic.5.t: "Obi-Wan travels to Kamino"
 republic.5.d: ""We've been expecting you"\n\nObi-Wan was settled to hear that when he landed on this rain drenched planet. Just exactly what was this place, it purpose, and how did it fit in with the Senator, the separatists, and the bounty hunter? In the meantime it seemed at least these Kaminoans would be helpful in giving him a few answers."
 republic.5.a: "\"I'm expected?\"" 
 republic.6.t: "Encounter at Kamino!"
 republic.6.d: "While on Kamino, Obi-Wan encounters the Mandalorian bounty Hunter Jango Fett. Fett revealed that he worked for a man named "Tyrannus". Kenobi sent a message to the council saying the Kaminoans were not responsible for the assassination attempt. The council responded by telling Kenobi to bring Fett to Coruscant for questioning. From there, a battle ensued as Fett refused to go before the Council. The battle ended rather quickly as both Jango and Boba Fett escaped Kenobi's grasp and left for the planet of Geonosis."

 republic.12.d: ""Protect the chancellor!"\n\n"Move move move!"\n\n The republic was in chaos. Master Windu's prediction of the separatist forces reaching Courscant had come true. Never before had the seppies been so bold as to stage an assault on the capital but it would seem they had gone all out. General Grievous stood mere feet away from the Chancellor. Thinking on her feet the Jedi master pulled the chancellor in with the force and unceremoniously dragged him off. It was not dignified of his status but she could deal with that later. She knew that their time was limited given the slices she heard of the brave clones that gave their life to buy them time. She just wish she knew how little that meant. No matter how far they ran Grievous hounded them. From elevator shafts to busy train lain. He and his magna guards seemed unstoppable. Which is how she made her last stand here holding off magna guards while Corobb and Moudama took the Chancellor to his shelter. That was until they seemed to be falling back even with their obvious numerical advantage unless. She ran, summoning every bit of the force she could muster to make her legs move faster. It couldn't be... but the scene that awaited her confirmed her fears. Corobb and Moudama lay dead, The Chancellor in the generals grasp. With what little strength she had left she tried to fight back but was effortlessly caught in his grip too. As some sort f creul jke th droid general tied her up and left her near the decaying bodies of her deceased comrades. Unknown to her was Obi-Wan and Anakin already entering the space above the planet and also the slight smirk on Palaptine's face as he was escorted away."
 #Mace Windu's prediction of the Seperatist forces reaching courscant have come true. Ships have quickly overwhelmed the Coruscant Defense Fleet and all reserves have been called back to the capital of the Republic. Seperatist General Grevious has captured Chancellor Palpatine after overwhelming his Jedi guard. Among the dead and missing includes Jedi Masters Roron Corobb and Shaak Ti." 
 republic.12.a: "Palpatine Captured!"
 republic.13.t: "Encounter With Dooku"
 republic.13.d: ""My powers have doubled since last we met Dooku"\n\nJedi knights Anakin and Obi-Wan had finally cut their way to the tower bridge of the invisible Hand. The flagship of Grievous. They did not expect resistant to be light but meeting the leader of the CIS itself but a surprise and not a welcome one. Even with it two against one and Anakin no longer a Padawan like he was on Geonosis Dooku proved to be more than capable of handling two at once. The room was a flurry of blue and red as sabers clashed in a deadly dance, Dooku putting all his years of swordsmanship to good use. With a chance at an opening found, Dooku flung Obi-Wan to the far side of the room. Further using the force to drop a platform on him the fight went from 2 on 1 to a 1 on 1 match. As was the plan. Dooku could feel the fear in Skywalker. The concern for his friend but also something else. Hate. Hate for him. For the CIS and their war. Exactly as his master planned. Brining Skywalker to the darkside was needed after all. He could even feel the power himself as Skywalker started anew with a flurry of violently slashes with his saber. The Sith Lord taunted him, egging him one. Something he would regret soon. Skywalker's rage reached its peak and with an underhanded maneuver Dooku lost both of his. Both appendages flying off and his own saber caught by Skywalker and both swords at his neck like a scissor.\n\n"Very god Anakin... now kill him. Kill him now."\n\nThe sudden change in the Chancellor's tone took both parties for a loop. Dooku remained convinced this was all part of the plan and that his master knw what he was doing but his life entirely in Skywalker's hands. Skywalker looked back at his captive and what the Chancellor was telling him vs the Jedi's teachings."
 #Jedi Masters Obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker have caught up to Count Dooku of Serenno on his flagship above the Republic capitol of Coruscant. Both Masters, leaders of their own clone armies, we're hoping to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine but instead they've been met with Dooku and his droid forces. Can the Jedi capture Dooku alive? Or will he become another causality of the war?"
 republic.13.a: "Do it!"
 republic.13.b: "Its not the Jedi way."
 republic.14.t: "Jedi Interrogate Dooku"
 republic.14.d: "Jedi forces have caputed the de facto head of the Separatist Alliance today over Coruscant. Count Dooku, Count of Serenno, and the first public Sith leader the galaxy has seen for quite some time. According to the Jedi Council, Dooku has provided a wealth of information, not only on the CIS but the modern Sith. Rumors say that Dooku has accused Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of being a Sith Lord. Galaxy News Network will keep you updated as this story progresses."
 republic.14.a: "Arrest the Chancellor"
 republic.15.t: "The Jedi Confront Palpatine"
 republic.15.d: "Jedi Forces have made their way through the administrative district of Coruscant to the residence of Chancellor Palpatine. Led by Jedi Master Mace Windu, these forces seek to apprehend the Supreme Chancellor and bring him to trial in front of the Galactic Senate."

 republic.15.b: "An End To All Of This"
 republic.16.t: "The End of the Seperatists"
 republic.16.d: ""Please! Please! No! Money! Riches! Anyth-"\n\nGunray never got to finish that as Skyw- No Darth Vader cut him down. No hesitation. o mercy. He and the rest of the separatist council. It did not matter they were made by and large for Palpatine in some proxy war. It did not matter how many times he had to risk his life fighting them. With his new found power he would be able to finally save his life. To stop those visions from becoming true. And the start of that was tying up lose ends from the war. The separatist council had served its purpose and it was time to cut those loose ends. He was at least glad he has given the job. For so long all that hate he held bottled up against them. Hate he was never allowed to show in the order. He was finally able to use his full power and do what was needed. Now they all lay dead and broken, the hellish landscape outside fitting for their end. He had brought peace, justice, and security his new Empire... and Padme would be proud."
