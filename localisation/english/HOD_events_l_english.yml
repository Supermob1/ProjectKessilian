 neutralsystems.1.desc:0 "Reports of crime syndicates such as the Black Sun are flooding in from across the city as they move in from the docks pillaging and terrorising our planets people. Our guards have been caught unprepared to fight off such an attack leaving us in a dire position.Deathwatch have moved into the palace and we need to make a decision on whether we sacrifice our morals and fight back against them, or listen to the people and allow a deathwatch government be put in place with Vizsla at the helm. It is quite clear that Deathwatch orchestrated this in order to get the support of the people, with Vizsla trying to make Mandalore a warrior system once again. Fighting back may lead us down a path of breaking neutrality as Count Dooku is having an increasing amount of involvement in our System's affairs. "
