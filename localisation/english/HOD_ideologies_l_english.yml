 new_order:0 "New Order"
 new_order_noun:0 "New Order"
 new_order_desc:0 "Imperialist Regime"
 # new_order_desc:0 "The New Order is more a grand political vision and state religion than it is a codified ideology. The New Order is one without the failures of democracy, a system wherein frailty is traded for strength, chaos for order, and uncertainty for decisiveness. And all of this is guided by the vision of the unquestioned and absolute rule of a wise leader and their chosen disciples. In the New Era of Power, the State is greater than any god, and loyalty the highest ideal. While often stable and powerful, without a greater cause and charismatic leader to rally the nation around, the New Order is quick to collapse in on itself."

 dark_side_desc:0 "Dark Side"
 # dark_side_desc:0 "Adherents to the Dark Side believe in using their passions and emotions to gain power, drawing on them for strength. The magocracy that rules any state that answers the call of the Dark Side is built on struggle and pain, with the strongest Force-user clawing their way to the top of the pile, wielding absolute and utter power. Often fragile and subject to power struggles, a Dark Side state only lasts so long as it is strong against this constant conflict. For them, peace is a lie."

 akaanadocrat_desc:0 "Akaan’adocrat"
 # akaanadocrat_desc:0 "Taken from the Mando’a word Akaan’ade, meaning Army, Akaan’adocrats seek the creation of a society where there is no distinction between government and military. In more extreme cases, the line between soldier and civilian is erased entirely as well. An akaan’adocratic system is one wherein political power is directly correlated with military rank, and prestige is earned from prowess in combat. While Mandalorian-inspired, any nation fitting this description, such as a migrant fleet under an admiralty or a military dictatorship, can be considered an Akaan’adocratic state."

 unitist_desc:0 "Unitist"
 # unitist_desc:0 "Unitism is a new political term to refer to the growing call for stronger leadership. Believing in the creation of a benevolent dictatorship or enlightened monarchy, Unitist hold that the unity of the nation against partisanship and radicalism is possible only by the intervention of a powerful neutral arbiter. While critics of popular democracy, Unitist do not believe in the fervent state worship of the New Order. Instead, citizens are free to dissent, disagree, and debate, but the presence of the uniting leadership prevents this from evolving into something more dangerous to stability. While good intentioned, a Unitist state can easily become a tyrannical autocracy."

 corist_desc:0 "Corist"
 # corist_desc:0 "While often a derogatory term, a Corist democracy is one that utilizes an aristocracy or some form of regulatory council to create a democracy that is in some way restricted. Often the wealthy and well-connected are the only ones who can enter office, but the vote is free and the executive leadership possesses minimal powers outside of an emergency. Many of the wealthy and influential systems of the Core Worlds and Inner Rim possess such systems, with Alderaan’s system of democracy with a monarchy and powerful noble houses often held up as the pinnacle of what Corist democrats believe should be the Galactic Standard for government."

 # distributionist_desc:0 "Inspired by long discredited political ideologies concerned with the redistribution of wealth, Distributionists take this concept and extend it further. A distribution of wealth, of food, of knowledge, of resources, or power; anything and everything will be shared with all the workers of the cosmos. Though divided on droid labor, Distributionists recognize that present galactic society has a vast super-abundance that must be shared, and advocate the use of a strong, mostly automated state to keep a fair system of redistribution, utilizing direct democracy for local initiatives and a powerful executive council of administrators to oversee the system. While a fringe ideology, tensions in the galaxy see them growing stronger and stronger."

Every citizen has a role to play in it, and every role is important in its own way to keep it functioning, so no person or group is given privilege or precedence over the others—but ultimately the whole revolutionary state is a unified system that depends on the collective sum of everyone's actions."

 # corporate_consortium_desc:0 "A corporate consortium refers to a state run by a consortium of businesses, whose power within the state is determined entirely by monetary wealth and social influence. This means that a corporate state is both one run by a multiple legitimate corporations, one run by a criminal cartel. In the end the difference is merely a matter of what kinds of business the leadership indulges in, and if they, at least officially, follow any set rules or regulations beyond rule through fear. The defining characteristic of any corporate consortium is the never-ending goal of profit above all else."

Under the occupationist doctrine, every mine shaft, dune rail, and oasis well falls under the watchful eyes of joint Republic–Corporate security forces. Local city-states retain nominal councils, but all real power resides with the Governor-Administrator and their cadre of corporate concessionaires. Martial law and privatized militias keep the peace, while ore convoys roll endlessly toward Coruscant’s forges. Though order reigns, whispered rebellions and smuggled arms belie the simmering resentment beneath the desert sun."

 # trade_democrat_desc:0 "A trade democracy is not a corporate state or an anarchistic one, but rather a stable democracy that focuses on the proliferation of the free market and the betterment of the economy. The idea that the freer the market, the freer the people, is the cornerstone of a trade democracy, which seeks to limit trade barriers and regulations. Some Trade Democrats argue for a strong stance against monopoly to ensure a free market, while other contend that monopolies are a natural consequence of trade, and urge coordination and cooperation between these monolithic businesses and the government for the good of the nation."

Any deviation beyond the system established by Tarsus Valorium is seen as doomed to fail. This means a weak Chancellery, a centralized Galactic Senate, rejection of Corist supremacy, rejection of militarism, and a strong aversion to investing any power, military or political, in the Jedi or any Force-user organization. This often makes Ruusanists the universally hated moderates amongst other political factions. Ruusanists often claim that the Reformation was a physical culmination of the Republic’s founding ideals, and often flaunt Old Republic symbols, even pre-Reformation, to proudly display their views to their opponents."

Believing that all viewpoints are welcome and of equal value, Inclusivism calls for the breaking down of class, regional, and species barriers in the pursuit of ending all discrimination. Derided as 'everyone is right' democracy, and blamed for the corruption, inefficiency, and political deadlock that has crippled the Republic, many still cling on to Inclusivist ideals, and fight to stay the course to equality and peace."

The magocracy that rules any state that studies the ways of the Light Side is typically built on experience and wisdom, with the wisest Force-user earning their position of leadership, their mastery of the Force a consequence of that wisdom rather than a cause, wielding absolute authority over their subordinates unless they delegate to others. Often prone to stagnation and ever threatened by the difficulty to stay the path of Light, a Light Side state only lasts if it can maintain total control of its society.
