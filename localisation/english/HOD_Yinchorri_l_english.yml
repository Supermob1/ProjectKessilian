 YIN_intro.1.t:0 "Yinchorr at the Crossroads"
 YIN_intro.1.d:0 "A harsh desert world of shifting dunes and scattered oases, Yinchorr sits atop vast mineral deposits but remains fractured by centuries of clan rivalries. In 976 RY the Republic, through its Corporate Consortium arm, formally established the Yinchorr Protectorate Administration. Martial law is in full effect, the planet’s mines have been privatized, and the once-proud city-states now answer only to Governor-Administrator Zatrax, a Falleen whose humanoid features are marked by fine, reptilian scales rather than ordinary skin. His cold efficiency and iron will keep both order and resource extraction moving without pause.\nWith the drums of war growing ever louder, Yinchorr must choose its fate. Will it deepen loyalty to the Republic under Zatrax’s iron fist, or will Shadowfang militants(secretly funded and armed by Trade Lord Karesh)spark a separatist uprising? The decisions made in the coming months will determine whether Yinchorr remains a jewel of exploitation or breaks free as a desert world reborn."
