 YIN_intro.1.t:0 "Yinchorr at the Crossroads"
 YIN_intro.1.d:0 "A harsh desert world of shifting dunes and scattered oases, Yinchorr sits atop vast mineral deposits but remains fractured by centuries of clan rivalries. In 976 RY the Republic, through its Corporate Consortium arm, formally established the Yinchorr Protectorate Administration. Martial law is in full effect, the planet’s mines have been privatized, and the once-proud city-states now answer only to Governor-Administrator Zatrax, a Falleen whose humanoid features are marked by fine, reptilian scales rather than ordinary skin. His cold efficiency and iron will keep both order and resource extraction moving without pause.\nWith the drums of war growing ever louder, Yinchorr must choose its fate. Will it deepen loyalty to the Republic under Zatrax’s iron fist, or will Shadowfang militants(secretly funded and armed by Trade Lord Karesh)spark a separatist uprising? The decisions made in the coming months will determine whether Yinchorr remains a jewel of exploitation or breaks free as a desert world reborn."
 YIN_intro.1.a:0 "Yinchorr’s Destiny is in our hands."

 YIN_intro.2.t:0 "Night Work in the Shattered Vale"
 YIN_intro.2.d:0 "Master Sha’Lar watches from a catwalk above a freight yard cut into the stone of the Shattered Vale. Yard lamps throw hard circles of light across sand and steel. Manifests list mining spares. The weigh slips do not match. A torn crate skin shows emitter linings and power housings. On the gantry, two lookouts trade the Shadowfang hand sign. Below, crawlers idle with cargo roped and sealed for departure.\nTwo trusted informants are still inside the chain: the ledger clerk in the weigh office and the night-shift foreman. A raid now would expose them and scatter the cells. If the convoy is allowed to move, trackers can be slipped under the tarps and the buyers, the safehouses, and the quartermaster can be taken together at the rendezvous. Acting tonight will seize the shipment and prove the plot, but it will also blow the cover, likely trigger a governor crackdown, and end the line into the higher planners. Holding back keeps the informants safe, preserves the map of the network, and follows the Jedi Code of restraint, but the Shadowfang will gain the cargo."
 YIN_intro.2.a:0 "Move in and stop the Shadowfang shipment."
 YIN_intro.2.b:0 "Hold cover, mark the cargo, and follow it to the buyers."
 
 YIN_intro.3.t:0 "After the Raid"
 YIN_intro.3.d:0 "In the days since the freight yard was taken, crates and ledgers have arrived at the Governor’s offices in sealed trains. Master Sha’Lar delivered the shipment intact. Power cells, emitter linings, route plans, and pay chits were counted and signed. Night arrests followed across the Shattered Vale and the city-states on its rim. Quartermasters and couriers sit in holding blocks. Several safehouses are shuttered, and a cache under a slag dump yielded rifles and field rations marked for the Shadowfang. Street rumor says the Order struck like a sandstorm and was gone before sunrise.\nWith the network cut this deep, the Protectorate garrison wants to press the advantage. They argue that the cells will splinter and then reform unless the sweeps continue. The city clerks and guild factors argue the opposite. With evidence in hand and the worst of the arming stopped, they say the emergency statutes have done their work. On Coruscant, legal officers signal that the conditions to end the emergency can now be claimed if the Governor so chooses. The desk is set with two orders. One keeps the iron framework in place and widens the dragnets. The other dissolves the military government, restores civil procedures, and sends the Governor to report the success before the Senate."

The Conservatives promise order, reliable charters, and steady concessions. The Reformists call for civil courts, water rights, and a fair share of the mines.\n\nPosters bloom in the alleys of the City of Spires, clan banners answer from the terraces.

 YIN_intro.7.d:0 "At noon the slag cranes stall and the south smelter’s day shift walks off the line. Heat pay, ration scales, and two supervisors who cut corners—on paper a routine dispute, in practice the first test of the season. Constables form a cordon. Clan speakers arrive with reed tablets. A broadcaster climbs a crate to catch every word.\n\nEach slate races to frame the moment: disorder that proves the need for a firm hand, or proof that a settlement can be reached without batons."

 YIN_intro.8.d:0 "The great forum opens under the wind-vanes. The Conservatives argue charters, guard-posts, and discipline on the roads. The Reformists argue courts, contracts, water rights, and a new division of revenues. Broadcasters want spectacle. The cabinet wants calm. The clans want their say.\n\nThe format chosen tonight will lean the scales as much as the words spoken on the floor."

 YIN_mlaw.6.t:0 "Children of the Thorn"
 YIN_mlaw.6.d:0 "At a ridge post two teenagers sit on a crate with their wrists bound, a cargo manifest beside them stamped for \"work assignment\" under curfew statutes. A sergeant waits for confirmation, a caravan leader waits for mercy, and the sun waits for no one. Master Sha'lar takes in the scene with the gravel road falling away to the north, where clan banners snap in the wind."
 YIN_mlaw.6.a:0 "Release minors and censure the post"
 YIN_mlaw.6.b:0 "Let the order stand for review"

 YIN_mlaw.7.t:0 "Audience with Zatrax"
 YIN_mlaw.7.d:0 "The Prefect's office looks out over a city that no longer speaks at night. Files sit by the window; decrees, arrest tallies, a map shaded in quiet. Zatrax stands behind a tidy desk, hands clasped. Master Sha'lar sets the ledger down and meets his eyes. What follows will decide more than a policy. It will decide who holds the line, and how."
 YIN_mlaw.7.a:0 "Compel Zatrax to stand down"
 YIN_mlaw.7.b:0 "Heed the Council and depart"
