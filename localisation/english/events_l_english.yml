 news.65.t:0 "THE DEATH OF CHANCELLOR PALPATINE"
 news.65.d:0 "The galaxy is in shock.\n\nLast night, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine passed away. His chief of staff, Sate Pestage, reportedly found him collapsed in his study. All signs indicate that the Chancellor suffered a heart attack. Given his age, and recent Separatist gains in the war, the attack was likely stress-induced. \n\nCondolences have poured in from across the galaxy, even from Separatist systems. Sheev Palpatine will be remembered as having dedicated every last breath to the preservation of the Republic."

 republic.1.t:0 "The State of the Galaxy"
 republic.1.d:0 "The Republic is facing a crisis. Ever since the passage of tax and tariff reforms resulted in the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation, relations between the Republic and its economic moguls have continued to deteriorate. Adding to this issue is increasing corruption and bureaucratic incompetence within the Republic, triggering unrest in non-Core systems. These dissidents, both industrialists and democratic reformers, have now rallied under former Jedi Master Dooku, the Count of Serenno.\n\nWith a full blown Separatist Movement at our doorstep, the Republic is torn on how to act. Some call for a military response, breaking centuries of pacifism. And while many feel the Separatists have valid points, there is great concern for the precedent that placating them would set. Paralyzed by inaction, the Seperatists only grow stronger.\n\n Beyond this, the Jedi fear that a Sith Lord is pulling to strings behind recent conflicts, and the galaxy seems set on the path to conflict."

 republic.2.t:0 "The Ritual"
 republic.2.d:0 "As the blade crossed his palm, Sidious let out little more than a slow exhale. He stared at the circle of runes and the pile of gore at its epicenter. And for a moment, he hesitated. \n\n This was old Sith sorcery. The kind that demanded a higher price than mere hatred. Its power would be immense, and its occurrence would be impossible to hide from the Jedi. But desperate time called for necessary measures. And while Sidious had plan upon plan, Dooku had become a dangerous liability. Correspondence had slowed, orders were followed with increasing inaccuracy, and his spies were being cut out of Dooku’s network. Sidious wondered if the old fool had grown a spine or a conscience. Was he no longer committed to the Sith, or was he at last planning to strike and take supremacy? \n\n Ultimately, it mattered little. What did matter was that Sidious no longer firmly controlled both sides of the conflict. He would soon have to fight a war. A real war, not a show where all danced to his instruction. The ritual was the answer to his quandry; to corrupt Skywalker’s soul, kill Dooku, and alter the course of the latest crucial battle would take time Sidious didn’t have. They had to happen now, and the Dark Side would aid him. \n\nLightning erupted from his fingertips, pouring energy into the blood offering. But as he chanted, channeling his hatred and wishes to call upon the Dark Side, something felt wrong. He did not feel the cold but welcome embrace of the darkness thanking him for his offering. He felt only... amusement, as if the Force sneered at him. He sent his demands again. ‘Corrupt the boy! Kill the fool! Win me my war!’ he snarled. But the darkness refused. He felt it then, cold claws digging into his heart. And he felt the anger, both chilling and burning as it weighed down upon him, forcing him to knees. Had he demanded too much, or offered too little? Or had the Dark Side merely grown tired of the Sith who thought himself its master?\n\n Sheev felt terror for the first time in decades."

 neutralsystems.1.desc:0 "Reports of crime syndicates such as the Black Sun are flooding in from across the city as they move in from the docks pillaging and terrorising our planets people. Our guards have been caught unprepared to fight off such an attack leaving us in a dire position.Deathwatch have moved into the palace and we need to make a decision on whether we sacrifice our morals and fight back against them, or listen to the people and allow a deathwatch government be put in place with Vizsla at the helm. It is quite clear that Deathwatch orchestrated this in order to get the support of the people, with Vizsla trying to make Mandalore a warrior system once again. Fighting back may lead us down a path of breaking neutrality as Count Dooku is having an increasing amount of involvement in our System's affairs. "
