 CIS_The_Raxus_Address_desc:0 "The time has come! After years of simmering tensions and political wrangling behind the closed doors of the senate, freedom from the Republic’s tyranny is possible. Count Dooku has offered to make an address, calling for the galaxy to throw off the chains of this long stagnant government and make a better future, and it is time at last to hear it."
 CIS_A_New_Birth_of_Freedom:0 "A New Birth of Freedom"
 CIS_A_New_Birth_of_Freedom_desc:0 "The address has struck a chord with many who seek escape from the Republic’s grasp. They have toiled too long under a government that cares nothing for their well being, and now is the time to begin forming a new government that will."

 CIS_War_of_Words:0 "War of Words"
 CIS_War_of_Words_desc:0 "We have said that we will seek no war with the republic, but that does not mean conflict will not exist. Our position and legitimacy in the Galaxy must be secured, both in the minds of our people and the powerful corporations and interest groups that may support us. It will not be an easy task to entrench our legitimacy, but nothing worth doing is easy"
 CIS_An_Open_Hand:0 "An Open Hand"

 CIS_Only_the_movement_Brings_Democracy_desc:0 "Many more moderate colleagues in the Republic believe in our ideals, but seek to reform it rather than build a new government that embodies them.

 CIS_Brushfire_Rebellions:0 "Brushfire Rebellions"
 CIS_Brushfire_Rebellions_desc:0 "The Republic has long neglected the needs of isolated and forgotten worlds at the edge of its space. These worlds are excellent places to spread our message.

 CIS_Against_Blackest_Injustice:0 "Against Blackest Injustice"
 CIS_Against_Blackest_Injustice_desc:0 "The Republic has long had a tradition of bigotry and discrimination of many non human species in the galaxy.

 CIS_A_Blade_in_the_Dark_desc:0 "The war with the republic may or may not spill out onto the battlefield, but there will be a body count long before then.

 CIS_Special_Interest_Groups:0 "Special Interest Groups"
 CIS_Special_Interest_Groups_desc:0 "While the support of the masses is all well and good, there are those groups who may not be large in number, but still hold much power. These corporations, lobbying groups, and industries must be appeased as well. "

 confederacy.1.t:0 "The Raxus Address"
 confederacy.1.d:0 ""My friends, it is a dark time for the galaxy. Though trillions cry out for succor, for the Republic to truly follow the ideals it claims to cherish, even for simple dignity, the Republic is unmoved! The luckiest of us are simply ignored, while the pleas of the rest are met with force pike and blaster. No one who holds power--not the oligarchs in the Senate, not the Core elite whose wealth props them up, not the soulless bureaucrats who rip food away from our mouths, not even the Jedi behind their temple walls--cares for the common galactic citizen. But for them, time has run out. Our cries have become a call to action. If they will not listen, will not acknowledge those people they claim to serve, they have no claim on us! No more will we lick the Republic's boots and beg for its scraps! No, the time for our freedom, for our independence, for our prosperous future, is now! In your name, I declare the Confederacy of Independent Systems a reality! And while we shall never seek war, to the Republic, I say you shall not bar our way!"\n\n  With these words, and more, Count Dooku has split the galaxy asunder. Worlds that once saw no alternative to living under unfavorable conditions imposed by the Republic now look to the growing Confederacy as a chance for a better future, and the Republic media is split between calling Dooku an insignificant demagogue and an existential, immediate threat to all the Republic. What is certain to all is that the the thousand-year status quo of the Galactic Republic has been changed forever."
