 confederacy.1.t:0 "The Raxus Address"
 confederacy.1.d:0 ""My friends, it is a dark time for the galaxy. Though trillions cry out for succor, for the Republic to truly follow the ideals it claims to cherish, even for simple dignity, the Republic is unmoved! The luckiest of us are simply ignored, while the pleas of the rest are met with force pike and blaster. No one who holds power--not the oligarchs in the Senate, not the Core elite whose wealth props them up, not the soulless bureaucrats who rip food away from our mouths, not even the Jedi behind their temple walls--cares for the common galactic citizen. But for them, time has run out. Our cries have become a call to action. If they will not listen, will not acknowledge those people they claim to serve, they have no claim on us! No more will we lick the Republic's boots and beg for its scraps! No, the time for our freedom, for our independence, for our prosperous future, is now! In your name, I declare the Confederacy of Independent Systems a reality! And while we shall never seek war, to the Republic, I say you shall not bar our way!"\n\n  With these words, and more, Count Dooku has split the galaxy asunder. Worlds that once saw no alternative to living under unfavorable conditions imposed by the Republic now look to the growing Confederacy as a chance for a better future, and the Republic media is split between calling Dooku an insignificant demagogue and an existential, immediate threat to all the Republic. What is certain to all is that the the thousand-year status quo of the Galactic Republic has been changed forever."
