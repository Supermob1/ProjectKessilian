 UNREST_NAME:0 "Unrest in the Galaxy"
 UNREST_DESC:0 "There is unrest in the Galaxy at large. Several systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. This Separatist movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order. As tensions rise and conspiracy brews, war seems inevitable..."
 REP_UNREST_DESC:0 "The Galactic Republic was once the most stable, respected, and beloved institution in Known Space. But in the present day, it is a crumbling, corrupt, and bloated bureaucratic entity. Systems have begun to abandon it in the form of the Separatist Movement, while numerous reformist factions vye for control. \n\nSome wish to stand by ideals of equality and inclusivity, no matter the cost, while others believe that centralization and ruthless efficiency is the way forward. And beyond the squabbling politicians, the Jedi stand seemingly blind the chaos, having grown arrogant and insular."
 CIS_UNREST_DESC:0 "Starting as the Separatist Movement of former Jedi and activist Count Dooku, the rapidly growing Confederacy is part social movement, part rebel government. Some of its advocates want to replace the Republic, others to create a new, separate systems, and others still have only joined as an expression of protest. Regardless, the group grows in strength and power each day, and can no longer be ignored. \n\nDooku and his corporatist backers clearly have their own agendas, but they spearhead a genuine coalition of the discontent. The Republic has failed them, but the Confederacy is their new hope."
 HTT_UNREST_DESC:0 "The Hutt Cartels are a ruthless criminal enterprise. As a species, the Hutts value greed and debauchery above all other things, and each of the slug-like sentients desire only to rise to power above their fellows. \n\nPeace, or at least cooperation, is maintained between the various clans through the Grand Hutt Council, representing the most powerful crimelords amongst the Hutt race. While criminals, the Hutts respect the Council. It's politics are byzantine and full of conspiracy, but in the end the Cartel stands together, and an attack on one Hutt is bring down the wrath of the Council."
 MAN_UNREST_DESC:0 "With war seemingly inevitable, Mandalore leads a movement of systems that, at a glance, seem similar to the Separatists. They have declared intentions to abandon the Republic, and are weary of its future. However, the so-called Neutral Systems Movement does not seek to create a new government. At least not yet. \n\nThose systems that flock to emulate Mandalore do so because they fear the oncoming war, and wish to declare themselves neutral and unaligned. Should shots be fired, the Neutral Systems will band together to stay out of the war, and taking action against them will only mean helping the enemy."
 CHS_UNREST_DESC:0 "Chiss Space sits within the Unknown Regions, parts of space not properly mapped or connected to the Republic's hyperspace lanes. An engimatic race, the Chiss prefer espionage to warfare.\n\nRuled by the noble oligarchy of the Aristocra, the Chiss watch the Galaxy from afar. But there are their own troubles to deal with. Threats exist outside of the Republic's eyes, and the Chiss are an unwitting vanguard."
 TCU_UNREST_DESC:0 "A conglomerate of technology companites, the Techno Union is a powerful corporate entity. They are led by Emir Wat Tambor, a ruthless technocrat. Officially, they are neutral in the Separatist Crisis, but in truth they lean towards Dooku. \n\nIf they abandon the Republic, the nation will lose a considerable technological advantage, as well as a sizable portion of their economy. In the modern galaxy, tech is power, and the Techno Union reigns supreme in that field."
 TDF_UNREST_DESC:0 "The Trade Federation is a shipping firm that dominates most of the trade and commerce that occurs between Republic Sectors. Heavily impacted by recent draconian commerical tax reform, the Trade Federation made a desperate protest by blockading and then invading Naboo. \n\nSince then, while their leadership evaded justice, the Trade Federation has grown ever more discontent with the Republic. They look to Dooku and the Separatists, bringing their massive droid army with them."
 OTHER_UNREST_DESC:0 "Other nations of the Galaxy..."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
