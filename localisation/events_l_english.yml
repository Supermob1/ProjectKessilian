 republic.1.d:0 "The Republic is facing a crisis. Ever since the passage of tax and tariff reforms resulted in the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation, relations between the Republic and its economic moguls have continued to deteriorate. Adding to this issue is increasing corruption and bureaucratic incompetence within the Republic, triggering unrest in non-Core systems. These dissidents, both industrialists and democratic reformers, have now rallied under former Jedi Master Dooku, the Count of Serenno.\n\nWith a full blown Separatist Movement at our doorstep, the Republic is torn on how to act. Some call for a military response, breaking centuries of pacifism. And while many feel the Separatists have valid points, there is great concern for the precedent that placating them would set. Paralyzed by inaction, the Seperatists only grow stronger.\n\n Beyond this, the Jedi fear that a Sith Lord is pulling to strings behind recent conflicts, and the galaxy seems set on the path to conflict."
